In the example, I use ghcr.io, but you can use any other registry.\nYou need to create a Coolify API Token and add it to your Github repository secrets.\nCOOLIFY_TOKEN in the example.\nIn Coolify, you need to setup your deployment type. It could be a simple Dockerfile, Docker Compose or Docker Image based deployment.\nGet the proper webhook endpoint from Coolify (Your resource / Webhook menu) and add it to your Github repository secrets.\nCOOLIFY_WEBHOOK in the example.\nNeed to send a GET request to that webhook endpoint (authenticated with the token) to trigger the deployment\nExample: curl --request GET '${{ secrets.COOLIFY_WEBHOOK }}' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.COOLIFY_TOKEN }}'\nThat’s it! Now you can push to your repository and the deployment will be triggered automatically.\nIntegration\nIntegration\ntwitter\ngithub\nPowered by Mintlify\nProcess Overview"

You can find the required variables in the official documentation.\n\nIf you need fine-grained token, like with Cloudflare, check the provider configurations.\n\n​\nConfiguration\nSetup your wildcard subdomain DNS records, *.coolify.io.\nGo to your Proxy settings (Servers / Proxy menu) and add the following configuration based on your providers. The example will use Hetzner as a provider.\nversion: '3.8'\nnetworks:\n  coolify:\n    external: true\nservices:\n  traefik:\n    container_name: coolify-proxy\n    image: 'traefik:v2.10'\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      - HETZNER_API_KEY=<API Key>\n    extra_hosts:\n      - 'host.docker.internal:host-gateway'\n    networks:\n      - coolify\n    ports:\n      - '80:80'\n      - '443:443'\n      - '8080:8080'\n    healthcheck:\n      test: 'wget -qO- http://localhost:80/ping || exit 1'\n      interval: 4s\n      timeout: 2s\n      retries: 5\n    volumes:\n      - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro'\n      - '/data/coolify/proxy:/traefik'\n    command:\n      - '--ping=true'\n      - '--ping.entrypoint=http'\n      - '--api.dashboard=true'\n      - '--api.insecure=false'\n      - '--entrypoints.http.address=:80'\n      - '--entrypoints.https.address=:443'\n      - '--entrypoints.http.http.encodequerysemicolons=true'\n      - '--entrypoints.https.http.encodequerysemicolons=true'\n      - '--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false'\n      - '--providers.file.directory=/traefik/dynamic/'\n      - '--providers.file.watch=true'\n      - '--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.httpchallenge=true'\n      - '--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.httpchallenge.entrypoint=http'\n      - '--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.dnschallenge.provider=hetzner'\n      - '--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.dnschallenge.delaybeforecheck=0'\n      - '--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.storage=/traefik/acme.json'\n      - '--providers.docker=true'\n    labels:\n      - traefik.enable=true\n      - traefik.http.routers.traefik.entrypoints=http\n      - traefik.http.routers.traefik.middlewares=traefik-basic-auth@file\n      - traefik.http.routers.traefik.service=api@internal\n      - traefik.http.routers.traefik.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt\n      - traefik.http.routers.traefik.tls.domains[0].main=coolify.io\n      - traefik.http.routers.traefik.tls.domains[0].sans=*.coolify.io\n      - traefik.http.services.traefik.loadbalancer.server.port=8080\n      - traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-https.redirectscheme.scheme=https\n      - traefik.http.middlewares.gzip.compress=true\n\n\nYou can also set env_file instead of environment in the example above, but then you need to create a .env file with the HETZNER_API_KEY variable on the server.\n\nChange --certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.dnschallenge.provider=hetzner to your provider.\n\nNow you have two options to configure your wildcard subdomain for your resources.\n\n​\nNormal\n\nIf you would like to use one (wildcard) certificate for all of your resources, you can use this option.\n\nIt is useful, because Traefik do not need to generate a new certificate for every resource, so new deployments will be available immediately without waiting for the certificate generation.\n\nIn your application, set your FQDN to a subdomain you would like to use: https://example.coolify.io.\ntraefik.enable=true\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.rule=Host(`example.coolify.io`) && PathPrefix(`/`)\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.entryPoints=https\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.middlewares=gzip\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.service=<unique_service_name>\ntraefik.http.services.<unique_service_name>.loadbalancer.server.port=80\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.tls=true\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.rule=Host(`example.coolify.io`) && PathPrefix(`/`)\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.entryPoints=http\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.middlewares=redirect-to-https\n\n​\nSaaS\n\nRedirect all subdomains to one application. You can use this option if you want to use Coolify as a SaaS provider.\n\nIn your application, leave the FQDN configuration empty.\nAdd the following custom label configuration:\ntraefik.enable=true\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.rule=HostRegexp(`{subdomain:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+}.coolify.io`)\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.entryPoints=https\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.middlewares=gzip\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.service=<unique_service_name>\ntraefik.http.services.<unique_service_name>.loadbalancer.server.port=80\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.tls=true\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.rule=HostRegexp(`{subdomain:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+}.coolify.io`)\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.entryPoints=http\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.middlewares=redirect-to-https\n\n\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.tls.certresolver should be the same as your certresolver name in Traefik proxy configuration, by default letsencrypt.\n\ntraefik.http.services.<unique_service_name>.loadbalancer.server.port should be the same as your application listens on.

This will make sure you can reach your server through Cloudflare Tunnels.\n\n2\n\nSetup Tunnels on Coolify\n\nAdd a new server with your server’s IP Address - it will be reconfigured later on.\n\nValidate the server.\n\nAfter the server is validated, click on Configure in the Cloudflare Tunnels section.\n\nPaste Cloudflare Tunnel Token from the previous step and set the SSH Domain to the domain you set in the previous step.\n\n​\nManual\n\nWIP\n\n​\nSetup Resources in Coolify\n\nYou have several options to use Cloudflare Tunnels with Coolify.\n\nOne domain -> One resource.\nWildcard subdomain -> All resources.\n​\nOne domain -> One resource\n\nIn this case, you need to add a public domain every time you would like to expose a new resource through Cloudflare Tunnels.\n\nYou can stop Coolify Proxy and set it to None, it is not needed in this case.\n\nGo to your tunnel settings on Cloudflare. (https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/ -> Networks -> Tunnels -> Select your tunnel)\nSwitch to Public Hostname tab.\nAdd a new Public Hostname.\nGo to Coolify and to your resource settings: - Remove any Domains settings. - Set Port Mappings to the same port that you set in the Public Hostname settings.\n\nAs an example, I’m deploying a static site, that listens in port 80 inside the container and I’m mapping it to the port 8888 on the host. So, I need to set the Port Mappings to 8888:80.\n\nDeploy & enjoy.\n​\nWildcard subdomain -> All resources\n\nIn this case, you only need to setup a wildcard domain once and you can expose all your resources through it.\n\nYou will need to use Coolify's Proxy to route the traffic to the correct resource.\n\nGo to your tunnel settings on Cloudflare. (https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/ -> Networks -> Tunnels -> Select your tunnel)\nSwitch to Public Hostname tab.\nAdd a new wildcard Public Hostname.\nIn Cloudflare go to Networks -> Tunnels and click on your tunnel name. From the sidebar copy the Tunnel ID.\nIn Cloudflare go to your DNS settings and add a new CNAME record with the following settings:\nName: *\nTarget: <Tunnel ID>.cfargotunnel.com\nTTL: Auto\nGo to Coolify and to your resource settings.\n\nSet the Domains to any subdomain of the wildcard domain you set in the previous step.\n\nYou need to use http:// in the Domains settings. Cloudflare will take care of the https part. For this you need to set SSL/TLS to Full in the SSL/TLS menu on Cloudflare.\n\nDeploy & enjoy.\n\nIf you would like to add a new resource, you only need to do point 6 and 7.\n\n​\nPost Setup\n\nAfter everything is setup, you can fully disable direct access to your server by disabling all the ports (except SSH (port:22 by default)) on your firewall.\n\n​\nSetup self-hosted Coolify\n\nYou can use the one domain without Coolify Proxy or wildcard setup with Coolify Proxy to expose your self-hosted Coolify instance to the internet.\n\nWith the wildcard setup, you have nothing to do.\n\nWith the one domain setup, you need a bit more setup with Coolify to make it work.\n\nLet’s say you configured the following Public Hostnames in Cloudflare:\n\napp.coolify.io mapped to localhost:8000\nrealtime.coolify.io mapped to localhost:6001\n\nAfter you installed Coolify, you need to add 3 lines your .env file, located in /data/coolify/source folder.\n\nAPP_ID=<random string>\nAPP_KEY=<random string>\nAPP_NAME=Coolify\nDB_PASSWORD=<random string>\nPUSHER_APP_ID=<random string>\nPUSHER_APP_KEY=<random string>\nPUSHER_APP_SECRET=<random string>\nREDIS_PASSWORD=<random string>\n\n###########\n# Add these lines\nPUSHER_HOST=realtime.coolify.io\nPUSHER_PORT=443\n###########\n\n\nThis tells Coolify how to connect to it’s realtime server through Cloudflare Tunnels.\n\nRestart Coolify with the installation script.\n\ncurl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash\n\n\nIf you have a firewall, you also need to allow the following ports.\n\n​\nVerify\nNavigate to your Coolify instance, as in the example: https://app.coolify.io.\nLogin with the root user (the first user you created after installation).\nOpen another tab/window and navigate to https://app.coolify.io/realtime. On the other tab (opened in point 2), you should see a notification about the test event.\nIf you know what are you doing, you can check the network tab as well.

It is called Raw Compose Deployment.\n\nThis is for advanced users. If you are not familiar with Docker Compose, we do not recommend this method.\n\n​\nWhat is still set?\n\nCoolify will still add the following labels (if they are not set) to your application:\n\nlabels:\n  - coolify.managed=true\n  - coolify.applicationId=5\n  - coolify.type=application\n\n​\nWhat to set?\n\nTo use Coolify’s Proxy (Traefik), you need to set the following labels to your application:\n\nlabels:\n  - traefik.enable=true\n  - \"traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.rule=Host(`coolify.io`) && PathPrefix(`/`)\"\n  - traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.entryPoints=http\n\n​\nConnect to Predefined Networks\n\nBy default, each compose stack is deployed to a separate network, with the name of your resource uuid. This will allow to each service in your stack to communicate with each other.\n\nBut in some cases, you would like to communicate with other resources in your account. For example, you would like to connect your application to a database, which is deployed in another stack.\n\nTo do this you need to enable Connect to Predefined Network option on your Service Stack page, but this will make the internal Docker DNS not work as expected.\n\nHere is an example. You have a stack with a postgres database and a laravel application. Coolify will rename your postgres stack to postgres-<uuid> and your laravel stack to laravel-<uuid> to prevent name collisions.\n\nIf you set Connect to Predefined Network option on your laravel stack, your laravel application will be able to connect to your postgres database, but you need to use the postgres-<uuid> as your DB_HOST environment variable.\n\nDocker Registry\nCustom Commands\ntwitter\ngithub\nPowered by Mintlify\nDefining environment variables\nRaw Docker Compose Deployment\nWhat is still set?\nWhat to set?\nConnect to Predefined Networks"

This will allow Coolify to do cleanups and other stuff on the Swarm Workers.\n\n​\nDocker Registry\n\nYou need to have an external Docker Registry available to use the a Swarm, as all workers need to be able to pull the images you built with Coolify.\n\nThe Swarm Manager needs to push the image to the Docker Registry.\nThe Swarm Workers need to pull the image from the Docker Registry.\n\nSo set your docker login credentials accordingly. More information here.\n\n​\nInstall Swarm Cluster\n\nWIP This is just a brief guide to install a simple Docker Swarm cluster. For more information, please refer to the official documentation.\n\n​\nPrerequisites\nI will use Hetzner (referral link) for this guide. You can use any other provider.\nYou need at least 3 servers to create a Docker Swarm cluster with the same architecture (ARM or AMD64).\n1 server for the manager node.\n2 servers for the worker nodes (you can add more worker nodes if you want).\nAdd private networking to all servers if possible.\n​\nInstall Docker\n\nInstall Docker on all servers. You can follow the official documentation or:\n\nInstall with Rancher script\ncurl https://releases.rancher.com/install-docker/24.0.sh | sh\n\nInstall with Docker script\ncurl https://get.docker.com | sh -s -- --version 24.0\n\n\nYou only need to use one of the above commands.\n\n​\nConfigure Docker\n\nOn all servers, run the following command to start Docker.\n\nsystemctl start docker\nsystemctl enable docker\n\n\nHetzner specific configuration. Hetnzer servers use a MTU of 1450. You need to configure Docker to use the same MTU.\n\nOn the manager, run the following command to configure Docker.\n\nmkdir -p /etc/docker\ncat <<EOF > /etc/docker/daemon.json\n{\n  \"default-network-opts\": {\n    \"overlay\": {\n      \"com.docker.network.driver.mtu\": \"1450\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nEOF\nsystemctl restart docker\n\n​\nCreate a Swarm cluster\n\nOn the manager node, run the following command to create a new cluster.\n\n# MANAGER_IP = IP of the manager node. If you have private networking, use the private IP, like 10.0.0.x.\ndocker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER_IP>\n\n\n\nThis command will output a command to join the cluster on the worker nodes.\n\nIt should look like something like this:\n\n# DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND, IT IS JUST AN EXAMPLE, HELLO!\ndocker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-24zvxeydjarchy7z68mdawichvf684qvf8zalx3rmwfgi6pzm3-4ftqn9n8v98kx3phfqjimtkzx 10.0.0.2:2377\n\n​\nVerify the cluster\n\nRun the following command on the manager node to verify the cluster.\n\ndocker node ls\n\n\nYou should see something like this:\n\nID                            HOSTNAME        STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION\nua38ijktbid70em257ymxufif *   swarm-manager   Ready     Active         Leader           24.0.2\n7rss9rvaqpe9fddt5ol1xucmu     swarm-worker    Ready     Active                          24.0.2\n12239rvaqp43gddtgfsdxucm2     swarm-worker    Ready     Active                          24.0.2\n\n\n​\nDeploy with persistent storage\n\nTo be able to deploy a service with persistent storage, you need to have a shared volume on the swarm-workers. So the Swarm service could move the resources between the swarm-workers.\n\nYou can always use services like AWS EFS, NFS, GlusterFS, etc.\n\nWIP\n\nCloudflare R2\nDocker Registry\ntwitter\ngithub\nPowered by Mintlify\nSetup in Coolify\nDocker Registry\nInstall Swarm Cluster\nPrerequisites\nInstall Docker\nConfigure Docker\nCreate a Swarm cluster\nVerify the cluster\nDeploy with persistent storage"

Coolify automates the process, you just need to login to the registry on the server.\n​\nHow to use?\n\nWhen you configure (or already configured) an application, you selected a server / network where it deploys. This will be your main server.\n\nAny additional servers must be set in the Servers menu, simply by clicking on it.\n\nNow everytime you redeploy, restart or stop the application, the action will be done on all servers.\n\nIf the deploy needs a build process, it will be executed on the main server (or on the build server if you have on). The deploy process will upload the built image to the Docker Registry and only after all other servers will be notified to pull and deploy this image.\n\n​\nHow to configure a loadbalancer?\n\nAt the moment, it is not automated. So you have to manually setup a loadbalancer. There are two ways to use.\n\n​\nPort mapping to host\n\nIf you set Ports Mappings for your application, so one port from the docker container will mapped to a port on the host server, all you need to do is to:\n\nSet all the IP:PORT as a destination in your loadbalancer.\nRemove any domains from the Domains field in Coolify.\n\nIn this case, Coolify Proxy is not used as you can reach the application with IP:PORT\n\nThis is super simple and effective. But keep in mind, that you need to only allow incoming connections to the selected PORT from the loadbalancer, otherwise everyone can reach your application directly, without the loadbalancer.\n\n​\nUsing a domain\n\nIn this case, you need to set the loadbalancer domain with HTTP, (not HTTPS) in the Domains field, and then set the proper configuration for your loadbalancer, with SSL termination.\n\nWith this configuration, you can use several domains with one loadbalancer.\n\nBuild Server\nOpenSSH\ntwitter\ngithub\nPowered by Mintlify\nRequirements\nHow to use?\nHow to configure a loadbalancer?\nPort mapping to host\nUsing a domain"

In this guide, we will show you how to deploy a load-balanced application with Coolify on Hetzner Cloud.\n\n​\nIntroduction\n\nYour application is growing, and you need to scale it. One of the most common ways to scale an application is to use a load balancer. A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed. This can help improve the performance and reliability of your application.\n\nIn this guide, we will show you how to deploy a load-balanced application with Coolify on Hetzner Cloud. We will use two (or more) servers to host our application and a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic. We will also show you how to set up a database server if you need one.\n\nThe whole infractructure costs around ~15€ per month.\n​\nRequirements\nA domain name managed by Hetzner Cloud\n2 (or more) servers on Hetzner Cloud\nA load balancer on Hetzner Cloud\nFirewall rules to restrict access to your servers\nOptional: A database server on Hetzner Cloud\n​\nSteps\n1\n\nBuy Servers\n\nFirst, you need to buy two (or more) servers on Hetzner Cloud. You can choose the server type and location based on your requirements. Make sure to choose servers with enough resources to run your application.\n\nImportant\n\nMake sure you create and attach a private network to your servers. This will allow your servers to communicate with each other using a private network.\n\nIf you don’t have an account on Hetzner Cloud, you can sign up with this referral link.\n\n2\n\nAdd & validate them in Coolify\n\nOnce you have bought the servers, you need to add them to Coolify. You can do this by clicking on the Add Server button in the Coolify dashboard and following the instructions.\n\nCoolify will automatically install the necessary software on your servers.\n\n3\n\nOptional: Deploy your database\n\nIt is preferable to have a separate database server for your application. Not just for performance reasons, but also for security reasons. Also in this way you can connect your applications to a centralized database server.\n\nSkip this step if you don’t need a database server or if you already have one hosted elsewhere.\n\nOnce you have bought the database server, and added it to Coolify, deploy your preferable database type (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) on it.\n\nImportant\n\nWe won’t use a reverse proxy in this guide. We will bind the database to the public IP address of the server. We will use a firewall to restrict access to the database server.\n\nYou can stop them on the Server tab and switch to a None proxy type.\n\nMake sure you set the Ports Mappings correctly to allow your application servers to connect to the database server.\n\nPostgreSQL: 5432:5432\nMySQL: 3306:3306\nMariaDB: 3306:3306\nMongoDB: 27017:27017\n4\n\nDeploy your applications\n\nNow it’s time to deploy your application on the app servers. Details of deploying your application will depend on the type of application you are deploying.\n\nWith Coolify, you can attach more than one server to the same application. This will allow you to deploy your application on multiple servers.\n\nImportant\n\nWe won’t use a reverse proxy in this guide. We will bind the application to the public IP address of the server, as the load balancer will handle the routing.\n\nYou can stop them on the Server tab and switch to a None proxy type.\n\nMake sure you set the Ports Mappings correctly to forward your application ports to the public IP address of the server.\n\nIf your application uses a database, make sure you update the database connection string to point to the database server.\n\nHetzner Cloud has a private network feature that allows you to connect your servers using a private network. This can help improve the security and performance of your application. Make sure you enable the private network feature on your servers and use it in the database connection string.\n\nTest if your application is working correctly by accessing the public IP address and port of the server in your browser.\n\n5\n\nAdd & configure the loadbalancer\n\nNow it’s time to add a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across your servers.\n\nThis loadbalancer will do the following:\n\nDistribute incoming traffic across your servers\nTerminates TLS connections (makes your application secure with HTTPS and forwards the traffic to your servers over HTTP)\nHealth checks your servers and routes traffic to healthy servers\n\nYour application is running on port 8000 on both servers and you have a domain name example.com.\n\nGo to the Hetzner Cloud Console and click on Load Balancers in the left sidebar.\nClick on the Create Load Balancer button.\nSelect a region where your servers are located.\nSelect the private network that you have created for your servers.\nSelect all servers in the targets section. Important: (use the private network).\nIn the services, delete the default service and add a TLS Termination predefined service.\nAs Destination Port enter 8000 (source port should be 443).\nAdd a certificate for your domain name. It will generate a certificate for your domain name using Let’s Encrypt.\nIn the health check section, configure the health check endpoint to your application health check endpoint. (just an endpoint that returns 200 OK).\nOptional: Sticky sessions can be enabled, which will make sure that a user is always routed to the same server for a time period, otherwise, the load balancer will distribute the traffic randomly across your servers.\nChoose an algorithm.\nAnd finally name your load balancer and click on Create & Buy now.\n\nWait for the load balancer to be created and healthy. Once it’s healthy, you can check if your application is accessible via the loadbalancer’s IP address.\n\n6\n\nSetup DNS\n\nNow it’s time to point your domain name to the load balancer's IP address. You can do this by adding an A record to your domain name provider’s DNS settings.\n\nGo to your DNS settings.\nAdd an A record with the domain name and the value of the load balancer’s IP address.\nSave the changes and wait for the DNS changes to propagate.\n\nOnce the DNS changes have propagated, you should be able to access your application using your domain name.\n\n7\n\nSetup Firewall\n\nHetzner Cloud offers a firewall feature that allows you to restrict access to your servers. We will use this feature to restrict access to your servers.\n\nAs the load balancer communicates with your servers over the private network, we only need to add rules for the public IP addresses.\n\nThe Inbound rules includes everything that is allowed. Everyting else is blocked by default.\n\nGo to the Hetzner Cloud Console and click on Firewalls in the left sidebar.\nClick on the Create Firewall button.\nAdd SSH access rule for your IP address to the Inbound rules.\nAdd your servers to the Apply rule section.\nName your firewall and click on Create Firewall.\n\nOptional: You can add more rules to allow access to specific ports or IP addresses if needed.\n\nAdd a service\nDelete User\ntwitter\ngithub\nPowered by Mintlify\nIntroduction\nRequirements\nSteps"

They are just normal docker-compose files with a bit of magic.\n\nTo add a new service, your can easily test your templates with Docker Compose deployments inside Coolify. It uses the same process to parse, generate and deploy as the one-click services.\n\nIf you are done with tests and everything works, open a PR, that have the new <service>.yaml compose file under /templates/compose.\n\nCoolify will use a parsed version.\n\n​\nRequest a new service\n\nIf there is a service template you’d like to see:\n\nSearch GitHub discussions here.\nIf it has already been requested, upvote it.

For example, if you set the port mapping to 8080:80, the container port 80 will be mapped to the host port 8080.\n\n​\nPublic Port\n\nPublic port is used to expose the container port to the internet, by starting an Nginx TCP proxy.\n\n​\nWhich one should I use?\nPort mappings makes the connection/port permanent (you need to restart your database to change it).\nThe public port makes the connection/port dynamic (you can change it without restarting the database, Coolify will restart the Nginx TCP proxy for you).\n​\nAccess database during builds\n\nIf you are using Nixpacks build pack, you have two ways to access your database during builds:\n\nDatabase & your application are in the same network: You can reach it using the internal URL provided by Coolify.\nDatabase & your application are not in the same network: You need to set enable yout database to be Accessible over the internet and use the public URL provided by Coolify.\nApplications\nDomains\ntwitter\ngithub\nPowered by Mintlify\nPorts Mapping vs Public Port\nPorts Mapping\nPublic Port\nWhich one should I use?\nAccess database during builds"

It could be a static site, a NodeJS application, a PHP application, etc.\n\nFor complex applications, you can use Docker Compose based deployments or the one-click services.\n\n​\nGeneral Configuration\n​\nCommands\n\nYou can overwrite the default commands by setting a custom value on the UI.\n\nBuild\nInstall\nStart\n\nIf you leave it empty, Nixpacks will detect which commands to run. For example, in Nodejs, it will check the lock files and run npm ci or yarn install or pnpm install accordingly.\n\n​\nBase Directory\n\nIt is useful for monorepos. You can set the base directory for all the commands that will be executed by Coolify.\n\n​\nPublic Directory\n\nIf you are building a static site, it is important to set the public directory, so the builder will know which directory to serve.\n\n​\nPort Exposes\n\nPort exposes are required for Docker Engine to know which ports to expose. The first port will be the default port for health checks.\n\nExamples:\n\nIf you have a NodeJS application that listens on port 3000, you can set it like this: 3000. If you have a PHP-FPM application that listens on port 9000, you can set it like this: 9000. If you have a Nginx server that listens on port 80, you can set it like this: 80.\n\n​\nPort Mappings\n\nYou will lose some functionality if you map a port to the host system, like Rolling Updates.\n\nIf you would like to map a port to the host system (server), you can do it here like this: 8080:80.\n\nThis will map the port 8080 on the host system to the port 80 inside the container.\n\nIf you would like to get performance boost and you do not need any domain (websocket server with VERY high traffic), you can map its port to the host, so the request will not go through the proxy.\n\n​\nAdvanced\n​\nStatic Site (Is it a static site?)\n\nThis feature is only available for Nixpacks buildpacks.\n\nIf you need to serve a static site (SPA, HTML, etc), you can set this to true. It will be served by Nginx. Disabled by default.\n\n​\nForce HTTPS\n\nIf you would like to force HTTPS, so no HTTP connections allowed, you can set this to true. Enabled by default.\n\n​\nAuto Deploy\n\nThis feature is only available for GitHub App based repositories.\n\nIf you would like to deploy automatically when a new commit is pushed to the repository, you can set this to true. Enabled by default.\n\n​\nPreview Deployments\n\nPreview deployments are a great way to test your application before merging it into the main branch. Imagine it like a staging environment.\n\nURL Template\n\nYou can setup your preview URL with a custom template. Default is {{pr_id}}.{{domain}}.\n\nThis means that if you open a Pull Request with the ID 123, and you resource domain is example.com the preview URL will be 123.example.com.\n\nIf you have several domains for your resource, the first will be used as the {{ domain }} part.\n\nAutomated Preview Deployments\n\nThis feature is only available for GitHub App based repositories.\n\nIf you would like to deploy a preview version of your application (based on a Pull Requests), you can set this to true. Disabled by default.\n\nIf set to true, all PR’s that are opened against the resource’s configured branch, will be deployed to a unique URL.\n\nManually Triggered Preview Deployments\n\nYou can manually deploy a Pull Request to a unique URL by clicking on the Deploy button on the Pull Request page.\n\n​\nGit Submodules\n\nIf you are using git submodules, you can set this to true. Enabled by default.\n\n​\nGit LFS\n\nIf you are using git lfs, you can set this to true. Enabled by default.\n\n​\nEnvironment Variables\n\nRead here\n\n​\nPersistent Storage\n\nRead here\n\n​\nHealth Checks\n\nBy default, all containers are checked for liveness.\n\nTraefik Proxy won’t work if the container has health check defined, but it is unhealthy. If you do not know how to set up health checks, turn it off.\n\n​\nRollbacks\n\nYou can rollback to a previous version of your resource. At the moment, only local images are supported, so you can only rollback to a locally available docker image.\n\n​\nResource Limits\n\nBy default, the container won’t have any resource limits. You can set the limits here. For more details, read the Docker documentation.\n\n​\nDeployment Types\n\nThere are several types of application deployments available.\n\nPublic Git Repository\nPrivate Git Repository (GitHub App)\nPrivate Git Repository (Deploy Key)\nBased on a Dockerfile\nBased on a Docker Compose\nBased on a Docker Image\n​\nBuild Packs\n\nThese are the supported build packs:\n\nNixpacks\nDockerfile\nDocker Image\nDocker Compose\n​\nNixpacks\n\nCoolify uses Nixpacks as build pack by default. Nixpacks detect what kind of application are you trying to deploy and builds it accordingly.\n\nBut if needed, you can customize it by adding a nixpacks.toml file to your repository or setting the right environment variables.\n\nFor example, if you are using a NodeJS application, you can set the NIXPACKS_NODE_VERSION to control the NodeJS version.\n\nWorth reading their documentation to understand how it works.\n\n​\nDockerfile\n\nDockerfile based build packs are useful if you have a custom dockerfile inside your Git repository.\n\n​\nCustom Dockerfile Location\n\nYou can always set your custom dockerfile location. By default, it is set to /Dockerfile.\n\n​\nDocker Image\n\nYou can deploy any docker images from any Docker compatible repository. For example, you can deploy images from Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.\n\n​\nDocker Compose\n\nDocker Compose based deployments are useful for complex applications. You can define multiple services in a single docker-compose.yml file and deploy them together.\n\nLanguages/Frameworks\nServices\nFAQ\nDatabases\ntwitter\ngithub\nPowered by Mintlify\nGeneral Configuration\nCommands\nBase Directory\nPublic Directory\nPort Exposes\nPort Mappings\nAdvanced\nStatic Site (Is it a static site?)\nForce HTTPS\nAuto Deploy\nPreview Deployments\nGit Submodules\nGit LFS\nEnvironment Variables\nPersistent Storage\nHealth Checks\nRollbacks\nResource Limits\nDeployment Types\nBuild Packs\nNixpacks\nDockerfile\nCustom Dockerfile Location\nDocker Image\nDocker Compose"

If you are planning to run a lot of things, you should consider buying a server with more resources.\n\nHosting Supabase, Appwrite or Posthog are requires more resources than hosting a static site (waay more).\n\nHere is an example. I’m hosting most of my production stuffs on a server with:\n\n- 8GB of memory (average usage 3.5GB)\n- 4 CPUs (average usage ~20-30%)\n- 150GB disk (usage 40GB)\n\n\nFor the following things:\n\n- 3 NodeJS apps\n- 4 Static sites\n- Plausible Analytics (for visitor analytics)\n- Fider (feedback tool)\n- UptimeKuma (uptime monitoring)\n- Ghost (my newsletters)\n- 3 Redis databases\n- 2 PostgreSQL databases\n\n​\nInstallation\n​\nAutomated\n\nThis works with Docker Engine (not Docker Desktop, for that, go here) on any supported Linux distribution.\n\n1\n\nSSH Enabled\n\nMake sure SSH is enabled and you can connect to your server with SSH from your local machine with root user: more details here.\n\nIf you would like to use a custom SSH port, you can set it on the localhost server after you installed Coolify.\n\n2\n\nCurl Installed\n\nMake sure curl command is available on your server.\n\n3\n\nInstall\n\nExecute the following command on your server with root user.\n\ncurl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash\n\n\nYou can find the source code of this script here.\n\n4\n\nOpen Coolify's UI\n\nNow you can access Coolify on port http://<ip>:8000 of your server.\n\nWhat it does? The script will do the following on your operating system.\n\nInstall basic commands: curl wget git jq jc\nDocker Engine (24+).\nConfigures proper logging for Docker Engine.\nCreates directory structure at /data/coolify for all the configuration files.\nCreates an SSH key for Coolify to be able to manage this server from itself at /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.\nInstall and start dockerized Coolify.\n​\nManually\n1\n\nSSH Enabled\n\nMake sure SSH is enabled and you can connect to your server with SSH from your local machine with root user: more details here.\n\n2\n\nCurl Installed\n\nMake sure curl command is available on your server.\n\n3\n\nInstall Docker Engine (24+)\n\nFollow the official documentation to install Docker Engine on your server: Docker Engine Installation.\n\n4\n\nCreate Directories\n\nCreate the base configuration directories under /data/coolify.\n\nmkdir -p /data/coolify/{source,ssh,applications,databases,backups,services,proxy,webhooks-during-maintenance}\nmkdir -p /data/coolify/ssh/{keys,mux}\nmkdir -p /data/coolify/proxy/dynamic\n\n5\n\nGenerate SSH Key\n\nGenerate an SSH key for Coolify to be able to manage this server from itself.\n\n\nssh-keygen -f /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal -t ed25519 -N '' -C root@coolify\n\n6\n\nSetup Your SSH Key\n\nAdd your public SSH key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. This will allow Coolify to connect to this server from itself.\n\ncat /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub >>~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n\nYou can skip this step if you already have an SSH key. But you need to add this key to your Coolify instance after installation.\n\n7\n\nSetup Configuration Files\n\nCopy the docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.prod.yml, .env.production & upgrade.sh files from Coolify’s CDN to /data/coolify/source.\n\ncurl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/docker-compose.yml -o /data/coolify/source/docker-compose.yml\ncurl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/docker-compose.prod.yml -o /data/coolify/source/docker-compose.prod.yml\ncurl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/.env.production -o /data/coolify/source/.env\ncurl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/upgrade.sh -o /data/coolify/source/upgrade.sh\n\n8\n\nSet Permissions\n\nSet permissions for all the files and directories.\n\nchown -R 9999:root /data/coolify\nchmod -R 700 /data/coolify\n\n9\n\nGenerate Values\n\nGenerate values for the following variables in /data/coolify/source/.env.\n\nsed -i \"s|APP_ID=.*|APP_ID=$(openssl rand -hex 16)|g\" /data/coolify/source/.env\nsed -i \"s|APP_KEY=.*|APP_KEY=base64:$(openssl rand -base64 32)|g\" /data/coolify/source/.env\nsed -i \"s|DB_PASSWORD=.*|DB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)|g\" /data/coolify/source/.env\nsed -i \"s|REDIS_PASSWORD=.*|REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)|g\" /data/coolify/source/.env\nsed -i \"s|PUSHER_APP_ID=.*|PUSHER_APP_ID=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g\" /data/coolify/source/.env\nsed -i \"s|PUSHER_APP_KEY=.*|PUSHER_APP_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g\" /data/coolify/source/.env\nsed -i \"s|PUSHER_APP_SECRET=.*|PUSHER_APP_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g\" /data/coolify/source/.env\n\n\nThis only needs to be done once, when you install Coolify for the first time. If you do it after Coolify has been started, it will break your installation.\n\nMake sure you save the values somewhere.
