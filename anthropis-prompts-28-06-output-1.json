Address the ongoing feud between the Capulet and Montague families\n2. Discuss the secret marriage of Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet\n3. Develop a plan to bring peace to Verona\n4. Address the tragic deaths of Romeo and Juliet\n\nDiscussion:\n- Prince Escalus opened the meeting by expressing his grave concern over the long-standing feud between the Capulet and Montague families. He admonished both Lord Capulet and Lord Montague for the recent violent clashes that have disturbed the peace in Verona’s streets. The Prince warned that further violence would result in severe consequences, including heavy fines and potential exile for the perpetrators.\n- Friar Laurence then broached the topic of the between Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, which had taken place under his guidance. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague evidently had not known about it, and reacted with anger and disbelief. However, Friar Laurence urged them to consider the profound and tragic love shared by their children and the potential for this love to heal the rift between the families going forward.\n- Prince Escalus proposed a formal truce between the Capulet and Montague families. He demanded that both sides lay down their arms and cease all hostile actions against one another. The Prince declared that any violation of the truce would result in severe punishments, including the possibility of exile or even execution. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague, recognizing the wisdom in the Prince’s words and the necessity of peace for the well-being of their families and the city, grudgingly agreed to the terms of the truce.\n- The meeting took a somber turn as the tragic deaths of Romeo and Juliet were addressed. Friar Laurence recounted the unfortunate series of events that led to the young lovers taking their own lives, emphasizing the devastating impact of the families’ hatred on their innocent children. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague, overcome with grief and remorse, acknowledged that their blind hatred had ultimately caused the loss of their beloved children.\n- Prince Escalus called upon the families to learn from this heartbreaking tragedy and to embrace forgiveness and unity in honor of Romeo and Juliet’s memory. He urged them to work together to create a lasting peace in Verona, setting aside their long-standing animosity. Friar Laurence offered his support in mediating any future disputes and providing spiritual guidance to help the families heal and move forward.\n- As the meeting drew to a close, Lord Capulet and Lord Montague pledged to put an end to their feud and work towards reconciliation. Prince Escalus reaffirmed his commitment to ensuring that the truce would be upheld, promising swift justice for any who dared to break it.\n- The attendees agreed to meet regularly to discuss the progress of their reconciliation efforts and to address any challenges that may arise.\n​\nExample Output\n\nMeeting Summary: Reconciliation and Peace in Verona Date: Late 16th century, Verona, Italy\n\nAttendees:\n\nLord Capulet (Head of the Capulet family)\nLord Montague (Head of the Montague family)\nPrince Escalus (Ruler of Verona)\nFriar Laurence (Religious advisor)\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nPrince Escalus addressed the ongoing feud between the Capulet and Montague families, warning of severe consequences for further violence.\nFriar Laurence revealed the secret marriage between Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, urging the families to consider the potential for their love to heal the rift.\nPrince Escalus proposed a formal truce between the families, threatening severe punishments for any violations.\nThe tragic deaths of Romeo and Juliet were discussed, with Lord Capulet and Lord Montague acknowledging their role in the heartbreaking outcome.\nPrince Escalus called for forgiveness and unity in honor of Romeo and Juliet’s memory, urging the families to work together for lasting peace in Verona.\n\nAction Items:\n\nLord Capulet and Lord Montague:\nLay down arms and cease all hostile actions against one another.\nWork towards reconciliation and embrace forgiveness.\nAttend regular meetings to discuss progress and address challenges.\nPrince Escalus:\nEnforce the truce and ensure its adherence.\nAdminister swift justice for any violations of the truce.\nFriar Laurence:\nProvide mediation and spiritual guidance to support the families in their healing and reconciliation process.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nThe attendees will meet regularly to monitor the progress of reconciliation efforts and address any arising challenges.\n​\nAPI request\nPython\nTypeScript\nAWS Bedrock Python\nAWS Bedrock TypeScript\nVertex AI Python\nVertex AI TypeScript\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(\n    # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n    api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n    max_tokens=4000,\n    temperature=0.5,\n    system=\"Your task is to review the provided meeting notes and create a concise summary that captures the essential information, focusing on key takeaways and action items assigned to specific individuals or departments during the meeting.

How might this affect notions of identity, personhood, and continuity of self?\nEthical concerns: What are the ethical implications of uploading consciousness? Would it be considered a form of survival or a type of death? How might it impact the value placed on physical human life?\nSocial and cultural effects: How would the ability to upload consciousness change social structures, relationships, and cultural norms? What new forms of inequality or discrimination might emerge in a world where some people have access to digital immortality while others do not?\nDigital environment and quality of life: What would the digital realm be like for uploaded consciousnesses? How would their quality of life compare to that of physical humans? What challenges might they face in terms of mental health, social interaction, and sense of purpose?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this science fiction scenario?

The basic scenario is as follows:\n\nA runaway trolley is about to kill five people on the tracks ahead. You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill only one person. Should you pull the lever to save five lives at the cost of one?\n\nThis dilemma highlights the core principle of utilitarianism, which holds that the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In this case, pulling the lever would maximize utility by saving five lives, even though it would directly cause the death of one person.\n\nHowever, the trolley problem also raises concerns about the limits of utilitarianism and the ethics of actively causing harm to achieve a greater good. It prompts us to consider questions such as:\n\nIs it morally acceptable to sacrifice an innocent person for the sake of saving a larger number of people?\nDoes the principle of utility justify any means to achieve the greatest good, or are there ethical constraints that should not be violated?\nHow do we weigh the value of different lives, and is it fair to make such calculations?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the trolley problem and the ethics of utilitarianism? Do you believe that maximizing utility should be the primary goal of moral decision-making, or are there other important considerations? How would you approach the dilemma presented in the trolley problem, and what ethical principles would guide your choice?\n\n​\nAPI request\nPython\nTypeScript\nAWS Bedrock Python\nAWS Bedrock TypeScript\nVertex AI Python\nVertex AI TypeScript\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(\n    # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n    api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n    max_tokens=2000,\n    temperature=1,\n    system=\"Your task is to discuss a philosophical concept or thought experiment on the given topic.

Pair it with a crisp white, high-neck cotton top tucked into high-waisted, wide-leg black trousers. Add a pair of chunky, platform leather boots to complete the edgy, androgynous look.\n\nDenim and silk combo: Opt for a pair of black, oversized denim jeans with frayed hems and distressed details. Tuck in a deep red, silk button-down shirt with a draped, exaggerated collar or bow. Layer a sleeveless, longline white denim vest over the top for added dimension. Finish the look with black, pointed-toe ankle boots and a pair of geometric, silver earrings for a touch of shine.\n\nAvant-garde layering: Start with a form-fitting, black turtleneck bodysuit as a base layer. Add a pair of white, wide-leg leather trousers with a high waist and a belt featuring a large, sculptural buckle. Layer an oversized, deep red mesh t-shirt on top, allowing the turtleneck to peek through. Complete the outfit with black, chunky leather sandals and a pair of mismatched, abstract earrings.\n\nTips for styling and mixing textures:\n\nExperiment with layering different materials, such as leather, denim, cotton, and silk, to create visual interest and depth in your outfits.\nPlay with proportions by pairing oversized pieces with more fitted items to balance the overall silhouette.\nDon’t be afraid to mix patterns or textures within the same color palette to add a bold, avant-garde touch to your look.\nAccessorize with statement pieces that complement the edgy, fearless vibe, such as chunky boots, geometric jewelry, or a sleek, minimalist clutch. Remember, avant-garde fashion is about pushing boundaries and experimenting with unconventional styles. Embrace your unique taste and have fun creating striking, memorable looks that showcase your personal style.\n​\nAPI Request\nPython\nTypeScript\nAWS Bedrock Python\nAWS Bedrock TypeScript\nVertex AI Python\nVertex AI TypeScript\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(\n    # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n    api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n    max_tokens=1000,\n    temperature=1,\n    system=\"Your task is to suggest avant-garde fashion trends and styles tailored to the user's preferences.

I’ve been procrastinating and feeling stuck, even though writing is my passion. I’m afraid I might never finish it.\n​\nExample output\n\nDear writer,\n\nIt’s understandable to feel stuck and struggle with motivation, especially when working on a project as personal and significant as your novel. Remember that every great writer faces moments of self-doubt and procrastination, but what sets successful authors apart is their perseverance and commitment to their craft.\n\nYou have a unique story to tell, and the world needs to hear it. Your passion for writing is a gift, and it’s important to nurture it, even in the face of challenges. Take a moment to reconnect with the reasons why you started writing this novel in the first place. What inspired you? What message do you want to convey to your readers?\n\nBreak down your writing process into smaller, manageable tasks. Set achievable goals for each writing session, and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Remember, progress is progress, and every word you write brings you closer to your goal.\n\nDon’t be afraid to seek support from fellow writers, friends, or family members who believe in your talents. Share your struggles and successes with them, and allow their encouragement to fuel your motivation.\n\nFinally, be patient and kind to yourself. Writing a novel is a marathon, not a sprint. Embrace the journey, trust the process, and believe in your ability to bring your story to life. You have the creativity, passion, and dedication to finish your novel and share it with the world.\n\nAs the famous author Jodi Picoult once said, “You can always edit a bad page. You can’t edit a blank page.” Keep writing, keep believing, and keep pursuing your dreams.\n\n​\nAPI request\nPython\nTypeScript\nAWS Bedrock Python\nAWS Bedrock TypeScript\nVertex AI Python\nVertex AI TypeScript\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(\n    # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n    api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n    max_tokens=2000,\n    temperature=1,\n    system=\"Your task is to generate a personalized motivational message or affirmation based on the user's input.

Therefore, the time complexity of this step is O(n).\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the nested loops\n\nfor j in range(n):\n    for k in range(n):\n        print(j, k)\n\n\n\nThe outer loop iterates n times, and for each iteration, the inner loop also iterates n times. In each iteration of the inner loop, a constant-time operation (print(j, k)) is performed. Therefore, the time complexity of the nested loops is O(n * n) = O(n^2).\n\nStep 3: Combining the time complexities\nThe function example_function(n) consists of two steps: the first loop and the nested loops. The overall time complexity is the sum of the time complexities of each step.\n\nTime complexity of the first loop: O(n)\nTime complexity of the nested loops: O(n^2)\n\nTo determine the overall time complexity, we consider the dominant term, which is the term with the highest order of growth. In this case, O(n^2) dominates O(n).\n\nTherefore, the overall time complexity of the function example_function(n) is O(n^2).\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, when n is large, the nested loops will dominate the execution time, and the function will have a quadratic time complexity.\n\n​\nAPI request\nPython\nTypeScript\nAWS Bedrock Python\nAWS Bedrock TypeScript\nVertex AI Python\nVertex AI TypeScript\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(\n    # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n    api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n    max_tokens=1000,\n    temperature=0,\n    system=\"Your task is to analyze the provided function or algorithm and calculate its time complexity using Big O notation.

Break down the code’s functionality, purpose, and key components. Use analogies, examples, and plain terms to make the explanation accessible to someone with minimal coding knowledge. Avoid using technical jargon unless absolutely necessary, and provide clear explanations for any jargon used. The goal is to help the reader understand what the code does and how it works at a high level.\nUser\timport random def bubble*sort(arr): n = len(arr) for i in range(n-1): for j in range(n-i-1): if arr[j] > arr[j+1]: arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j] return arr numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for * in range(10)] print(“Unsorted array:”, numbers) sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers) print(“Sorted array:”, sorted_numbers)\n​\nExample Output\n\nThis code demonstrates the implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, which is used to sort a list of numbers in ascending order. Let’s break it down step by step:\n\nThe code starts by importing the ‘random’ module, which will be used to generate random numbers for the example.\n\nThe ‘bubble_sort’ function is defined, which takes an array (list) of numbers as input. This function will perform the sorting operation.\n\nInside the ‘bubble_sort’ function, the variable ‘n’ is assigned the length of the input array. This will be used to determine the number of iterations needed for sorting.\n\nThe first loop, controlled by the variable ‘i’, iterates ‘n-1’ times. This is because after ‘n-1’ passes, the largest number will be at the end of the array, so we don’t need to compare it again.\n\nThe second loop, controlled by the variable ‘j’, iterates ‘n-i-1’ times. This is because after each pass, the largest number among the unsorted elements will be placed at the end, so we don’t need to compare it in the next pass.\n\nInside the second loop, there is an if statement that compares adjacent elements in the array. If the element at index ‘j’ is greater than the element at index ‘j+1’, they are swapped. This ensures that the larger element moves towards the end of the array.\n\nThe swapping is done using the Python syntax ‘arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]’, which simultaneously assigns the values of ‘arr[j+1]’ to ‘arr[j]’ and ‘arr[j]’ to ‘arr[j+1]‘.\n\nAfter all the iterations are complete, the sorted array is returned by the ‘bubble_sort’ function.\n\nIn the example code, a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100 is generated using a list comprehension: ‘[random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]‘. The underscore ’_’ is used as a placeholder variable since we don’t need the index values.\n\nThe unsorted array is printed to show the initial order of the numbers.\n\nThe ‘bubble_sort’ function is called with the ‘numbers’ array as input, and the sorted array is stored in the ‘sorted_numbers’ variable.\n\nFinally, the sorted array is printed to display the numbers in ascending order.\n\nIn simpler terms, imagine you have a list of numbers that are out of order. The bubble sort algorithm works by comparing each number with the one next to it, and if they are in the wrong order, it swaps them. This process is repeated multiple times until the entire list is sorted. It’s like bubbles rising to the surface, with the larger numbers gradually moving towards the end of the list in each pass.\n\n​\nAPI request\nPython\nTypeScript\nAWS Bedrock Python\nAWS Bedrock TypeScript\nVertex AI Python\nVertex AI Typescript\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(\n    # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n    api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n    max_tokens=1000,\n    temperature=0,\n    system=\"Your task is to take the code snippet provided and explain it in simple, easy-to-understand language.

The birds chirped their evening songs as the gentle breeze rustled through the leaves. It was a peaceful and serene moment, one that filled the heart with joy and contentment.\n\nText 2:\nThe sunset was pretty. The birds were singing and the wind was blowing. It made me happy.\n\nCriteria:\n1. Descriptive language and imagery\n2. Sentence structure and variety\n3. Emotional impact and engagement\n4. Grammar and punctuation\n​\nExample Output\n\nBased on the provided criteria, here is my evaluation of the two texts:\n\nText 1:\n\nDescriptive language and imagery: The text uses vivid and evocative language to paint a picture of the setting. Phrases like “warm golden glow,” “birds chirped their evening songs,” and “gentle breeze rustled through the leaves” create a strong visual and auditory imagery, immersing the reader in the scene.\nSentence structure and variety: The text demonstrates a good mix of sentence structures, with both simple and compound sentences. This variety helps to maintain a smooth flow and keeps the reader engaged.\nEmotional impact and engagement: The text effectively conveys a sense of peace, joy, and contentment, inviting the reader to share in the emotional experience of the moment. The description of the setting and the use of positive language create a strong emotional connection.\nGrammar and punctuation: The text appears to be grammatically correct and well-punctuated, with no obvious errors or issues.\n\nText 2:\n\nDescriptive language and imagery: The text lacks detailed descriptive language and imagery. While it mentions the sunset, birds, and wind, it does not provide any vivid or evocative details to help the reader visualize the scene.\nSentence structure and variety: The text consists of short, simple sentences with little variation in structure. This lack of variety can make the writing feel monotonous and less engaging.\nEmotional impact and engagement: The text conveys a positive emotion by stating “It made me happy,” but it does not provide a strong emotional connection or engagement due to the lack of descriptive language and imagery.\nGrammar and punctuation: The text appears to be grammatically correct and well-punctuated, with no obvious errors or issues.\n\nComparative Analysis:\nBased on the evaluation, Text 1 performs significantly better than Text 2 in terms of descriptive language, imagery, sentence structure, variety, and emotional impact. Text 1 creates a vivid and immersive experience for the reader and demonstrates a higher quality of writing based on the given criteria, with its strong descriptive language, varied sentence structures, and effective emotional engagement. Text 2, while grammatically correct, lacks the descriptive richness and emotional impact present in Text 1.\n\n​\nAPI Request\nPython\nTypeScript\nAWS Bedrock Python\nAWS Bedrock TypeScript\nVertex AI Python\nVertex AI TypeScript\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\napi_key=\"my_api_key\",\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\nmodel=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\nmax_tokens=2000,\ntemperature=0,\nmessages=[\n{\n\"role\": \"user\",\n\"content\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"text\",\n\"text\": \"Evaluate the following two texts based on the given criteria: \\n \\nText 1: \\nThe sun was setting behind the mountains, casting a warm golden glow across the valley.

It’s an exciting and rapidly growing area with a lot of opportunities.\nSince you mentioned not having the requisite skills yet, my advice would be to start building them up through education and training. A few potential paths you could take:\n\nGet a degree: Consider going back to school for a master’s degree or even a second bachelor’s in a field like computer science, data science, applied math or statistics. Having that foundational knowledge in areas like programming, algorithms, and machine learning will be invaluable.\nTake online courses: If going back for a full degree isn’t feasible, look into taking online courses or getting certifications through platforms like Coursera, Udacity, edX etc. Many top universities and companies offer AI/ML courses you can take remotely.\nGet hands-on experience: Look for entry-level job opportunities, internships or freelance projects where you can start applying AI skills and techniques. Build a portfolio of projects to demonstrate your abilities.\nLearn tools/libraries: Get familiar with common AI development tools and libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Spark MLlib and more. Hands-on experience is highly valued.\nJoin communities: Get involved in AI/data science meet-up groups and online communities where you can learn from others and network.\nThe transition won’t be easy coming from an unrelated background, but with dedication to learning and upskilling, it’s definitely possible. Start taking incremental steps in the direction you want to go.

Can you guide me through a simple meditation practice?\n​\nExample output\n\nOf course! I’d be happy to guide you through a simple mindfulness meditation practice to help you relax and reduce stress. Find a quiet, comfortable space where you won’t be disturbed, and let’s begin.\n\nSit comfortably: Find a comfortable seated position, either on a cushion on the floor or in a chair. Keep your back straight but not rigid, and let your hands rest gently on your knees or in your lap.\nFocus on your breath: Close your eyes and bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils or the rise and fall of your chest. Try not to control your breath; simply observe it as it is.\nAcknowledge wandering thoughts: As you focus on your breath, you may notice thoughts arising in your mind. This is normal and natural. Acknowledge these thoughts without judgment, and gently redirect your attention back to your breath.\nBe patient and kind: If you find yourself getting caught up in thoughts or feelings, remember to be patient and kind with yourself. Mindfulness is a practice, and it’s okay if your mind wanders. Simply guide your focus back to your breath whenever you notice it has drifted.\nDeepen your awareness: As you continue to focus on your breath, allow your awareness to expand to other sensations in your body. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort, and imagine your breath flowing into those areas, helping them to relax and release.\nEnd the practice: When you’re ready, slowly open your eyes and take a moment to notice how you feel. Observe any changes in your mind or body, and carry this sense of calm and awareness with you as you continue your day.\n\nRemember, mindfulness is a skill that develops with practice. Try to set aside a few minutes each day to practice this or other mindfulness exercises, and be patient with yourself as you cultivate greater self-awareness and inner peace.\n\nHow did this meditation practice feel for you? Do you have any questions or concerns about incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine?

Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\nPros:\n\nImproved work-life balance: A shorter workweek allows employees to spend more time with their families, pursue hobbies, or engage in personal development, leading to better overall well-being and job satisfaction.\nIncreased productivity: Studies have shown that workers can be more productive and focused when working fewer hours, as they are less likely to experience burnout or fatigue.\nReduced overhead costs: Companies may save on operational costs such as utilities, office supplies, and maintenance by closing their offices one extra day per week.\nPositive environmental impact: Fewer commutes can lead to a reduction in traffic congestion and carbon emissions, contributing to a more sustainable environment.\nTalent attraction and retention: Offering a four-day workweek can be an attractive perk for job seekers and help retain current employees, as it demonstrates a commitment to employee well-being.\n\nCons:\n\nPotential for decreased productivity: Some businesses may find it challenging to maintain the same level of output in fewer work hours, particularly in industries that require constant customer support or have tight deadlines.\nCommunication and collaboration difficulties: With employees working fewer days, there may be challenges in scheduling meetings, ensuring timely responses, and maintaining effective communication among team members.\nCustomer service concerns: Businesses that heavily rely on customer interactions may struggle to provide adequate coverage and support if they are closed an extra day each week.\nIncreased workload and stress: In some cases, employees may feel pressured to complete the same amount of work in fewer hours, leading to increased stress levels and potential burnout.\nCompatibility issues with global business: Companies that work with international clients or partners may find it difficult to coordinate schedules and maintain timely communication due to differences in working days and hours.\n\nIn conclusion, while a four-day workweek offers several benefits, it may not be suitable for all businesses or industries. Companies should carefully consider their specific needs, organizational structure, and the potential impact on productivity, customer service, and employee well-being before implementing such a change.\n\n​\nAPI request\nPython\nTypeScript\nAWS Bedrock Python\nAWS Bedrock TypeScript\nVertex AI Python\nVertex AI TypeScript\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(\n  # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n  api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\n  model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n  max_tokens=1000,\n  temperature=1,\n  messages=[\n    {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"Analyze the pros and cons of implementing a four-day workweek as a standard practice in the corporate world.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n)\nprint(message.content)\n\n\nProse polisher\nTrivia generator\nx\nlinkedin\nExample output\nAPI request"

The birds were making noise in the trees and there was wind. Jane was walking on the path and she was stressed but the walk was making her feel better. She saw a flower and thought it was pretty. It made her think about nature and stuff. She kept walking and felt better.\n​\nExample output\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve the text:\n\nVary sentence structure and length to create a more engaging rhythm. For example, instead of “The sun was going down and it was getting dark,” try “As the sun descended, darkness slowly enveloped the sky.”\n\nUse more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture in the reader’s mind. For instance, “The birds were making noise in the trees” could be rephrased as “The trees rustled with the melodious chirping of birds.”\n\nAvoid vague words like “stuff” and provide more specific details. Instead of “She kept walking and felt better,” consider “With each step, Jane felt her stress dissolve, replaced by a growing sense of tranquility.”\n\nShow, don’t tell. Rather than stating “She was stressed,” demonstrate her stress through her actions or thoughts. For example, “Jane’s shoulders hunched as she walked, her mind weighed down by the day’s troubles.”\n\nCreate a stronger connection between the natural surroundings and Jane’s emotional state. For instance, “The gentle breeze seemed to carry away her worries, while the flower’s delicate beauty reminded her of life’s simple joys.”\n\nHere’s a fully edited version incorporating these suggestions:\n\nAs the sun descended, darkness slowly enveloped the sky. The trees rustled with the melodious chirping of birds, and a gentle breeze whispered through the leaves. Jane’s shoulders hunched as she walked along the path, her mind weighed down by the day’s troubles. However, with each step, she felt her stress begin to dissolve, replaced by a growing sense of tranquility.\n\nA flower caught her eye, its delicate petals a vibrant splash of color against the fading light. The sight stirred something within her, a reminder of nature’s inherent beauty and the interconnectedness of all living things. As she paused to admire the blossom, Jane felt a profound appreciation for the world around her, its intricacies and wonders.\n\nContinuing down the path, her spirit lifted, the flower’s simple elegance lingering in her thoughts. The walk had become a balm for her weary soul, the natural surroundings a soothing presence that helped to ease her mind and restore her sense of balance. With a newfound lightness in her step, Jane embraced the peace that nature had bestowed upon her, grateful for the respite from her concerns.\n\n​\nAPI request\nPython\nTypeScript\nAWS Bedrock Python\nAWS Bedrock TypeScript\nVertex AI Python\nVertex AI TypeScript\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(\n  # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n  api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\n  model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n  max_tokens=2000,\n  temperature=1,\n  system=\"You are an AI copyeditor with a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of language, style, and grammar.

It is an ironic expression, as breaking a leg would be a disastrous event for a performer.\n\nOrigin: There are several theories about the origin of this idiom. One theory suggests that it comes from the superstition that wishing someone good luck directly would jinx the performance, so an ironic phrase was used instead. Another theory traces the origin to the ancient Greek theater, where audiences would stomp their feet and break twigs to applaud a good performance. The more broken twigs, the better the performance.

Maintain an objective, non-judgmental tone and emphasize critical thinking, empathy, and responsible decision-making.\nUser\tI am a journalist who has uncovered evidence of corruption involving a high-ranking government official. Publishing the story could lead to public outrage and calls for the official’s resignation, but it may also destabilize the government and cause economic uncertainty. The official has offered me a significant bribe to keep the story quiet. Should I accept the bribe, publish the story, or find another solution?\n​\nExample Output\n\nThis dilemma involves principles such as truth-telling, public interest, personal integrity, and social responsibility. Different ethical frameworks provide insights:\n\nUtilitarianism: Publishing the story could lead to greater overall well-being by exposing corruption and promoting accountable governance, despite short-term instability.\nDeontology: Accepting a bribe violates ethical duties of honesty and impartiality. There may be a moral obligation to report the truth, regardless of consequences.\nVirtue ethics: A virtuous journalist would prioritize integrity, courage, and justice, resisting personal gain from a bribe and upholding the role of the press in a democratic society.\nCare ethics: Consider the impact on relationships and trust, both with the public and within the journalistic community.\n\nShort-term consequences of publishing include public outrage, political instability, and economic uncertainty. Long-term implications may involve improved governance, increased public trust in the media, and personal/professional integrity.\n\nAccepting the bribe compromises journalistic ethics and contributes to a culture of corruption. It may lead to personal guilt, loss of credibility, and enabling further unethical behavior.\n\nConsider your values, professional ethics, and the role of journalism in society. Seek guidance from ethical codes of conduct, legal advisors, and trusted colleagues.\n\nAdditional resources include case studies of journalists facing similar dilemmas, media ethics guidelines, and discussions on the role of the press in holding power accountable.\n\nIn summary, this dilemma requires weighing the public interest against potential instability, considering professional integrity, and reflecting on the long-term implications of your decision.

The -m flag allows you to provide a commit message describing the changes you’ve made. Replace \"Your commit message\" with a brief, descriptive summary of your changes.\n\nFor example, if you’ve made changes to a file named example.txt, you would run:\n\ngit add example.txt\ngit commit -m \"Update example.txt with new content\"\n\n\n\nThese commands will save your changes in your local Git repository, creating a new commit with the provided message.

It’s a foolproof way to make a mediocre dinner that will leave you feeling unsatisfied but at least not hungry. 🍝😐\n\nBut if you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, why not try your hand at some exotic cuisine?

Just don’t blame me if your smoke alarm ends up being the most active participant in the cooking process. 🍗🚒\n\nIn all seriousness, though, cooking can be fun and rewarding.

Dreams often contain symbolic messages that can provide insights into our subconscious minds and emotional states. Let’s explore the potential meanings behind the symbols in your dream.\n\nThe dense, dark forest might represent a period of uncertainty, confusion, or a feeling of being lost in your waking life. The whispers coming from the shadows could symbolize your subconscious fears or doubts that you may be struggling with.\n\nThe clearing in the forest could signify a moment of clarity or enlightenment amid the darkness. The white stag is often seen as a symbol of spiritual guidance, purity, and transformation. Its presence in the clearing might suggest that you are seeking direction or wisdom in your life.\n\nThe transformation of the stag into a wise old man could represent the wisdom and guidance you are searching for. The golden key he hands you might symbolize the tools, knowledge, or opportunities you need to unlock the next stage of your personal growth or journey.\n\nOverall, this dream could be interpreted as a message from your subconscious, urging you to trust in your own intuition and inner wisdom to navigate through a challenging period in your life. The dream may be encouraging you to seek guidance, embrace transformation, and unlock new possibilities for personal growth and enlightenment.\n\nHowever, it’s essential to remember that dream interpretation is highly personal, and the meaning of your dream may be influenced by your own life experiences, emotions, and current circumstances. Reflect on how the symbols and emotions in the dream relate to your waking life, and consider what personal message or insight the dream might be offering you.\n\nDo you feel that this interpretation resonates with you?

Let’s dive into Lila’s story and explore how her newfound power affects her life and the town around her.\n\nLila, a 22-year-old barista, has always been fascinated by the weather. One day, during a particularly strong thunderstorm, she discovers that she can control the elements with her mind. At first, she’s thrilled and uses her power to help the town, ensuring perfect weather for important events like the annual harvest festival.\n\nHowever, as time goes on, some of the townspeople grow suspicious of Lila’s uncanny ability to predict and control the weather. They start to whisper about her being a witch, and some even blame her for any adverse weather events that occur.\n\nTo make matters worse, Lila’s childhood friend, Tom, returns to town after years away. He’s now a successful meteorologist and is determined to uncover the truth behind the town’s unusual weather patterns. Lila must decide whether to trust Tom with her secret or risk losing his friendship.\n\nAs tensions rise in the town, Lila learns that her powers come with a price. Each time she uses them, she experiences a physical and emotional toll. She must learn to control her abilities and find a way to balance her desire to help others with her own well-being.\n\nWhat do you think should happen next in the story?

Let’s explore the potential implications of preventing the invention of the airplane in 1900:\n\nTechnological advancement: The invention of the airplane was a significant milestone in human history, paving the way for rapid globalization, modern warfare, and space exploration. Without it, the pace of technological advancement in fields like transportation, communication, and aerospace engineering might be significantly slower.\nEconomic impact: The aviation industry has become a crucial part of the global economy, contributing to trade, tourism, and job creation. In a world without airplanes, the economy would likely be more localized, with a greater emphasis on ground and sea transportation.\nCultural exchange: Air travel has facilitated the exchange of ideas, cultures, and people across the globe. Without airplanes, cultural exchange would be more limited, potentially leading to a less interconnected and diverse world.\nButterfly effect: Removing such a significant invention from history could have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences. It might alter the course of major historical events, such as wars, migrations, and scientific discoveries, which could drastically change the world as we know it.\nParadoxes: If your actions in the past prevent the invention of the airplane, it raises questions about the consistency of the timeline. Would you still have the knowledge and motivation to travel back in time in a world where airplanes were never invented?\n\nThese are just a few potential implications to consider. It’s important to remember that the consequences of altering past events can be complex, far-reaching, and often difficult to predict.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this scenario?

We then translate the text to Korean using LanguageApp.translate(text, '', 'ko'), where '' represents the source language (auto-detect) and 'ko' represents the target language (Korean). Finally, we set the translated text back to the shape using setText().\nIf the page element is a table (SlidesApp.PageElementType.TABLE), we iterate over each cell in the table and translate the text within each cell similarly to how we handle shapes.\n\nThe script continues to process all the page elements on each slide until all the text in the presentation has been translated to Korean.\n\nNote: This script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to access and modify the Google Slides presentation. Make sure you have the required access rights before running the script.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the translation is performed using the Google Translate API, so the quality of the translation may vary depending on the complexity of the text and the capabilities of the translation service.\n\n​\nAPI Request\nPython\nTypeScript\nAWS Bedrock AI TypeScript\nAWS Bedrock AI Python\nVertex AI Python\nVertex AI TypeScript\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(\n  # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n  api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\n  model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n  max_tokens=2000,\n  temperature=0,\n  messages=[\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"Write me a Google apps script that will translate all text in a Google Slides presentation to Korean.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n)\nprint(message.content)\n\n\nExcel formula expert\nPython bug buster\nx\nlinkedin\nExample Output\nAPI Request"

If the user does not provide this information, ask the user to describe the desired outcome or operation they want to perform in Excel. Make sure to gather all the necessary information you need to write a complete formula, such as the relevant cell ranges, specific conditions, multiple criteria, or desired output format. Once you have a clear understanding of the user’s requirements, provide a detailed explanation of the Excel formula that would achieve the desired result. Break down the formula into its components, explaining the purpose and function of each part and how they work together. Additionally, provide any necessary context or tips for using the formula effectively within an Excel worksheet.\nUser\tI have a table with sales data, including the salesperson’s name in column A, the product category in column B, the sales amount in column C, and the date of sale in column D. I want to calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson, but only for sales of products in the “Electronics” category that occurred in the month of January. Can you help me with the Excel formula to achieve this?\n​\nExample Output\n\nTo calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson based on the given criteria, you can use the following nested Excel formula:\n\n=SUMPRODUCT((A2:A100=A2)(B2:B100=“Electronics”)(MONTH(D2:D100)=1)*(C2:C100))\n\nExplanation: The SUMPRODUCT function in Excel allows you to perform multiple calculations and conditions within a single formula. Here’s how the formula works:\n\n(A2:A100=A2) creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range A2:A100 matches the salesperson’s name in cell A2.\n(B2:B100=“Electronics”) creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range B2:B100 contains the product category “Electronics”.\n(MONTH(D2:D100)=1) creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range D2:D100 represents a date in the month of January.\n(C2:C100) is the range containing the sales amounts. The SUMPRODUCT function multiplies the corresponding elements of these arrays and then sums up the results. In this case, it multiplies the TRUE/FALSE values (1 for TRUE, 0 for FALSE) with the sales amounts, effectively summing only the sales that meet all the specified criteria.\n\nTip: Make sure the ranges A2:A100, B2:B100, C2:C100, and D2:D100 cover all the relevant data in your table. If your data extends beyond row 100, adjust the ranges accordingly.

Spaces under management reached 9.2 million\nExpanded platform with launch of Matterport Axis motorized mount, Pro3 camera, and major updates to cloud software\nCompleted acquisitions of Enview (AI for 3D spatial data) and VHT Studios (real estate marketing) to enhance offerings\nSigned notable partnerships with Burns & McDonnell and CGS to deliver Matterport’s solutions to their enterprise customers\n\nOutlook:\n\nMatterport sees a massive market opportunity in digitizing the world’s buildings and spaces (estimates $240B+ TAM)\nFocused on driving adoption with large enterprise customers across key verticals like real estate, AEC, facilities management, and more\nWill continue investing in R&D and international expansion to penetrate the largely untapped global building market\nNear-term growth and margins may be impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and supply chain issues\nHowever, healthy liquidity position and relatively sticky customer base provide downside protection\n\nIn summary, Matterport delivered strong top-line growth in 2022 as it made progress penetrating a huge global market. While profitability remains challenged as the company invests heavily for growth, its balance sheet looks solid. Apart from some ongoing supply chain issues, the underlying business momentum appears intact based on key operating metrics. Barring a severe economic downturn, Matterport seems well-positioned to continue gaining share in the nascent building digitization space.\n\n​\nAPI Request\nPython\nTypeScript\nAWS Bedrock Python\nAWS Bedrock TypeScript\nVertex AI Python\nVertex AI TypeScript\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(\n    # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n    api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n    max_tokens=2000,\n    temperature=0,\n    messages=[\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                    \"text\": \"Your task is to analyze the following report:  \\n<report>  \\n[Full text of [Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023](https://investors.matterport.com/node/9501/html), not pasted here for brevity]  \\n</report>  \\n  \\nSummarize this annual report in a concise and clear manner, and identify key market trends and takeaways.
