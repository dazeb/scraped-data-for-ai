This lets users know which plugin they need to update before Elementor updates.\n\nImportance of compatibility tags\n\nAs an open-source project, Elementor includes an extensive developers API. This enables the creation of a vast ecosystem of 3rd party extensions that enhances Elementor’s capabilities. \n\nNote\nCurrently, there are over 500 addons that extend Elementor’s capabilities.\n\nWhen 3rd party developers don’t update their extensions to make them compatible with the latest versions of Elementor, users can experience problems with their websites. To protect their websites from possible future conflicts, Elementor provides a Compatibility Tag that notifies users about plugins that may not be compatible with their currently-installed version of Elementor. This makes debugging easier, if required.\n\nImportant\nLook for the compatibility tag for any 3rd party plugins you are using before updating Elementor.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nLogin to WP Admin.\nGo to Elementor > System Info.\n\nScroll down to view compatibility tags.\n\nIf there is no compatibility tag, but Elementor knows that the 3rd party plugin is not compatible with a new version of Elementor, a message will be displayed if it is not safe to continue with the update.\n\nFor example, you may see an alert, followed by a list of incompatible plugins, similar to this:\n\nCompatibility Alert – Some of the plugins you’re using have not been tested with the latest version of Elementor. To avoid issues, make sure they are all up to date and compatible before updating Elementor.\n\nBenefits of using compatibility tag\n\nCompatibility tag compliance ensures that users will decrease the number of conflicts, and other issues with new Elementor releases. Key features of compatibility tags:\n\nCompatibility tags provide transparency and information as to which plugins should be updated before Elementor updates.\nThis mechanism reduces conflicts when using Elementor with external addons and 3rd party plugins\nThis transparency and accountability for addons helps create the optimal experience for both plugin developers and for users because it reduces the friction that can occur  when add-ons conflict with new Elementor releases.\n\nElementor encourages all addon developers to add the compatibility tag to their plugins. For details, see New Developers Feature – Compatibility Tag.\n\nHave more questions?

It is designed to render the page faster by loading the text and media only without scripts and many styles.\n\nSince AMP renders the WP editor content in a minimal fashion, it is not fully compatible with Elementor created content.\n\nNote\nAMP does not necessarily improve SEO. Using AMP causes a page to load faster which may increase the number of visitors. This increase can improve SEO listing.\nSolution\n\nYou can optimize your responsive website using Flexbox and other page speed improvement features of Elementor. For details about these speed improvements, see What Are Performance Experiments. \n\nImportant\nIf you experience the “Preview could not be loaded” error, it might be related to AMP.

To avoid this, below are some steps you can take to prevent any difficulties from affecting your live site.\n\nRecommended steps before updating\nMake a backup\n\nWhile you should regularly backup your website this is especially important before updating. \n\nFor Elementor Hosting users, see Back up your website for more details.\n\nIf you’re using third-party hosting, consult your website host or you can use a WordPress backup plugin.\n\nRead the documentation on the new release. \nFor WordPress updates, check out the WordPress.org news section\nFor the Elementor and Elementor Pro plugins this includes blog posts, changelogs, and community announcements. You can check the plugin changelogs here (Core) and here (Pro).\nCheck Addon compatibility \n\nMany creators use Elementor addons. These addons are created and maintained by third parties.Before updating, we recommend checking with these third-parties to make sure they are compatible with the most recent version of Elementor and Elementor Pro.\n\nFrom WP-Admin, go to Elementor>Apps for a list of popular tools that can enhance websites while using Elementor. \n\nTest the update on a staging site.\nFor Elementor Hosting users with a Business, Grow or Scale plan, your site comes with a staging site. For more details see, What is a staging site?\nIf your site is hosted with a third-party, check with your hosting party about setting up a staging site. In many cases, these staging sites are not considered a license activation so you can use Elementor Pro on them without an issue. See Is my staging site considered a license activation? for more details. However, if your staging site is not on the list of approved sites, you may have  to temporarily deactivate your Elementor Pro license from the live site to activate it on the staging site, unless you have multiple licenses available. \nYou can set up a staging site on your own compute using a solution such as Local by Flywheel. When building a staging website using a local machine, Elementor Pro doesn’t register as an install, meaning you can run Elementor Pro on your local machine and on your online website at the same time. This works on .local, .dev, and .test domains. The disadvantage is that the system settings won’t be exactly the same as your live site.\n\nYou can use an external staging site service such as WP Stagecoach or WP-Staging.  The disadvantage is that the system settings won’t be exactly the same as your live site.\n\nHave more questions?

Menu items  generally link to the most important pages such as, Home, Contact Us, Blog etc. \n\nWhile Elementor provides you with many cool and creative ways to present your menu to users, the menu itself is a WordPress function and has to be created via the WordPress dashboard. \n\ninfo\nNote\nCheck out the Elementor Menu widget for a more streamlined way to create menus and mega menus. For more details, see Menu widget.\nBuilding your menu\nCreate a top level menu\n\nTo build your website’s navigation top level menu:\n\nSelect Appearance>Menus from the WordPress dashboard.\n\nGive your menu a name and click Create Menu.\n\nAt this point you can choose to have the menu automatically appear in the header and/or footer. You can also set up the menu to automatically include newly created top-level pages in the menu. Top-level pages are the main page of a section and often have sub-pages under them.\nOnce you create the menu, you’ll be able to add pages to it. \nUse the checkmarks to select which pages will be included in the menu.\n\nUse the Add menu items menu to choose between adding Pages, Posts, Custom Links and Categories to the menu.\n\nSelect Add to Menu.\n\n\nAfter adding pages to your menu, they will appear in the Menu structure section. \n\nYou can rearrange the order of the menu by dragging and dropping menu items. Click the arrow next to the menu item for additional options such as renaming it. After making changes, remember to click Save Menu.\n\nNote\nYou can also add posts, custom links and entire categories to your menu.\n \n\nCreate submenus\n\nIn many cases, you’ll want to create submenus (sometimes called children) for menu items. For instance, you may have a general Contact Us page with separate subpages for each department, which you want visitors to easily access.\n\nTo create submenus:  \n\nSelect Appearance>Menus from the WordPress dashboard.\nUse the checkmarks to select the subpages, and click Add to Menu.\n\nOnce these subpages become part of the menu, drag them under and slightly to the right of the top-level page.  \n\n\nThis same procedure can also be used to create subsubmenu items.\n\nRelated articles\n\nNav Menu widget\nCreate a hamburger menu\nCreate a dropdown menu\n\nHave more questions?

Elementor has introduced a number of features to help improve your page speed by reducing code and optimizing the DOM, among other improvements. These are called experimental features and are specifically marked as Performance experiments.\n\nTo view and activate performance experiments:\n\nLogin to WP Admin.\nGo to Elementor > Settings > Features.\n\nThe Ongoing Experiments lists the experimental features.\n\nPerformance features currently in the experimental stage are:\n\nImproved Asset Loading – Should improve page speed by only loading the functionalities needed by that page. This experiment reduces the amount of code loaded by default, which translates to significantly faster page load times and better page speed scores.\nInline Font Icons – This experiment renders icons as SVGs without loading the Font-Awesome and eicons libraries. Since SVGs are vector-based images which are rendered using the browser’s engine, they do not increase server requests which improves performance.\nRelated articles\nActivate Elementor Experimental Features\nOptimize Speed For Elementor Websites\nElementor Academy: Empower Your Web Creation Skills\n\nHave more questions?

For example, Google Analytics code or Facebook Pixel code. You can add any kind of JavaScript code to tweak the DOM, add events and dynamic features and much more. You can use CSS snippets to add custom styling to any element on the site.\n\nNote\nCustom code does not support PHP snippets. You cannot use this feature to add custom hooks or actions. You can use a different approach for PHP, either through functions.php or a third-party plugin.\n\nTo add custom code, follow these steps:\n\nLogin to WP Admin.\n\nGo to Elementor > Custom Code. The Custom Code page shows.\n\nClick Add New Custom Code. The New Code page shows.\n\nEnter the following:\nAdd title – It helps you identify this code snippet later.\nLocation – Determines the section of the webpage where the code will be located. Choose from the following options:\n<head> –  at the page level\n<body> – Start –  at beginning of the page’s body\n<body> – End –  at end of the page’s body\nPriority – Choose from (1 – 10). If multiple scripts are assigned to the same location, the priority levels determine the order in which they should run.\n\nNote\nLower numbers indicate higher priority. So a script with a priority of 1 will have a higher priority than a script with a priority of 5.\nEnter or paste the code snippet in the code block editor. The built-in code linter checks your code and notifies you of error, if any.\nFrom the Publish block, for Conditions click Edit. The PUBLISH SETTINGS window shows.\n\nSet the desired conditions. For details, see How To Set Display Conditions For Global Templates.\n\nClick Publish. You can also save the custom code as draft or set a later publish date & time.\n\nNote\nIn addition to scripts, you may also add CSS to your website by wrapping it between the HTML style tag. This allows you to only include the CSS based on the conditions you set. See example below:\n\nCode with Elementor AI\n\nYou can use Elementor to generate your custom code. See Add Custom Code Using Elementor AI for more details.\n\nHave more questions?

Putting your site into maintenance mode presents visitors with a message notifying them of why your site is offline and prevents them from encountering broken links, corrupted data or other apparent bugs. \n\nWith Elementor’s Maintenance Mode, you can display a custom maintenance mode page to visitors, and notify search engines that your site is undergoing maintenance to avoid hurting your SEO.\n\nCreate a maintenance mode template\n\nCreate a maintenance mode page template set up the maintenance site.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nLogin to WP Admin.\nClick Templates > Add New. The NEW TEMPLATE window shows.\n\nChoose template type as Page.\nGive a name to your template. (For example, coming soon, maintenance)\n\nClick Create Template. The page opens in an editable form with a header and footer.\n\nClick the gear icon (page settings). The Page Settings panel shows.\n\nFrom Page Layout, choose Elementor Canvas. The page displays as a plain canvas without a header and footer.\n\n\nNote\nThis is to prevent the users from accessing any link while the website is under construction or under maintenance mode.\nClick the add template icon. The LIBRARY window shows.\nSearch for ‘coming soon’.

The site sends the temporary maintenance response (HTTP 503). This way, search engines know that they needs to come back a short time later to check again if the site is already online. This ensures that the website SEO listing is not affected. \n\nThe following 3rd party cache plugins are automatically cleared on every change in Maintenance Mode:\n\nWP Rocket (premium)\nW3 Total Cache (free)\nWP Super Cache (free)\nWP Fastest Cache (free + premium)\n\nHave more questions?

This is called a permalink. \n\nFor Elementor Hosting sites, these permalinks default to: website name/post-name.  You can customize permalinks to create more comprehensible links to your posts and pages.

If your custom code is affected, you will need to rewrite your CSS, taking into account the new HTML structure. For more details about these changes, check out our developers update.\n\nStarting with Elementor 3.0, some significant DOM improvements have been made to boost the speed and performance of new Elementor websites. These improvements involved removing a number of HTML wrapper elements that were output by Elementor.\n\nRemoving these wrapper elements from the DOM contributes to simplified code output, better readability and less complexity. A smaller DOM contributes to increases in speed and performance. However, removing these elements may affect some web creator’s custom code.  \n\nHTML Wrappers Removed\nElementor Version 3.6\n\nRemoved elementor-section-wrap\n\nElementor Version 3.2\n.elementor-image\n.elementor-text-editor\nElementor Version 3.0\n.elementor-inner\n.elementor-row\n.elementor-column-wrap\nImportant\nStarting with Elementor 3.19, these DOM improvements were fully incorporated into the Elementor Core meaning they are not longer optional. If you used any of these wrapper classes in your custom CSS or custom code, you need to refactor your code to use different wrapper classes that aren’t being removed. Otherwise, your custom styles or code will no longer function properly.\n\nSee the developers post about this change here.\n\nHave more questions?

Elementor allows you to keep the editor interface in your preferred language, while you work on a site in a different language. \n\nSetting the editor’s language\nFirst you’ll need to make sure both the site’s languages and your preferred language are installed in the system. From the WordPress dashboard, go to the Settings>General tab. \nThe Site Language should be set to the language of your site. Use the dropdown to select the language you would like to work in. \n\nGo to the WordPress>Settings tab\n\n\nClick Save Changes. The language you selected will now be installed and the WordPress dashboard will appear in your selected language.\n\nNote the list of installed languages at the top of the list.\n\n\nNow that you’ve installed your desired language, you’ll need to switch the site language back to the language of the site. Use the dropdown menu to select the site’s language and click Save Settings (when you switch languages, buttons will appear in whatever language you chose).\nNow that the language is installed, go to WordPress > Users > Profile and select your desired language from the Language dropdown (if there is more than one user profile for the site, make sure your user profile is selected).\n\nSetting the language preference for a user.\n\n\nClick Update Profile.

Beta versions of Elementor will not contain these experimental features, but beta versions will be much more stable due to the work accomplished in the Developer Edition. \n\nFeedback, including bug reports, feature suggestions and suggestions for improvement, will be used to evaluate and validate new features before they are released.\n\nImportant: Use with caution. Please do not use Developer Edition on production sites. Developer Edition releases, just like beta releases, may not be stable. Use it on staging environments only, and back up your entire website before updating.\n\nDownload Instructions\n\nThe plugin can either be downloaded and installed from the WordPress repository or from your WordPress dashboard.\n\nVia WordPress.org:\nGo to https://wordpress.org/plugins/ and in the search field, enter Elementor Developer Edition. Click the plugin’s title and then click the Download button.\nFrom your WordPress dashboard, click Plugins > Add New. Choose the zip file you have just downloaded. Click on install and activate\nVia WordPress Dashboard:\nFrom the dashboard, click Plugins > Add New.\nIn the Search field, enter Elementor Developer Edition and choose the plugin to install.\nAfter installation, click Activate.\n\nNote: The plugin requires Elementor to properly activate, so both plugins must be running and active at the same time. The Developer Edition is an addon that brings you updates from our ongoing and updating development channel\n\nInstructions for Use\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, it functions just like the production version of Elementor. You’ll find the plugin’s available options in the Elementor sidebar menu. Here, you can:\n\nUpdate to the latest version, if available.\nActivate auto-updates if you’d like.\nOpt in to participate in non-sensitive data usage sharing, which allows you to help us extend our ability to perfect our product and produce experimental and groundbreaking features.\nRe-install the latest stable version. Just go to Elementor [Dev] > Developer Edition and click the Re-install now button to automatically revert to the stable version of Elementor. You will still need to deactivate and delete the Developer Edition plugin.\n\nNote: If you delete the Developer Edition plugin before you’ve clicked the Re-install now button, you won’t revert to a stable Elementor version automatically. In that case, you would need to install the stable version of Elementor manually using the rollback feature found in Elementor > Tools > Version Control. \n\nOnce you’ve configured the options, you are ready to begin using Elementor. You will use the Development Edition in the same way you would use the stable version, however you’ll notice that there may be new features or changes in the user interface that are not present in the stable, production version. You will also notice a few visual aids to remind you that you are using the Development version, including the following:\n\nThere’s a “Dev Badge” in the WP sidebar as well as in the editor’s top bar\nSource code: in the elementor body tag, added the “elementor-dev”class \nIn the WordPress dashboard admin top bar, next to your user avatar, you’ll find a link to “Report an issue” which will enable you to report a problem on github.\nElementor Editor top bar badge\nWordPress dashboard top bar badge\n\nImportant to repeat: Use with caution. Please do not use Developer Edition on production sites. Developer Edition releases, just like beta releases, may not be stable. Use it on staging environments only, and back up your entire website before updating.\n\nDeveloper Edition FAQs:\nWhy am I not seeing the update notification?\nThere are some instances where the notification takes a while to appear. Try to refresh it by going to Dashboard > Updates, and click on “Check again”. In addition, you can try clearing your site’s cache and see if the update appears.\nWhere can I report bugs or contribute to Elementor?\nOn the top admin bar, you will see a button with the text ‘Report an issue’. Once you click on the link you will be redirected to the issue template form.\nWhere do updates come from?\nElementor Developer Edition versions are downloaded from the WordPress.org SVN repository. These versions will only be available to your site if you use the Elementor Developer Edition plugin. \nCan I rollback to an earlier version?\nYes! You can always take advantage of Elementor’s rollback option and revert to an earlier more stable version, or alternatively click “Re-install Now” on the Developer Edition page.\nIs it safe to use Developer Edition?\nThe Developer edition is an unstable version and should be used for staging sites only. We advise you to backup your website before trying the version.\nWhich features will roll out to the next version of Elementor?\nThe features that roll out to stable versions will do so gradually. This means not all features presented in the Elementor Developer Edition will be incorporated into the upcoming version. We might even remove features from this version from time to time based on the experiment status.\nI’m already a beta tester, isn’t it the same?\nBeta versions are the designated version for release. Developer Edition versions may include extra features or experiments that are not available in either the Stable or Beta versions. These experiments may be rolled out gradually.   \n\nHave more questions?

You’ll need to design several site parts and sections to build a professional and stunning website.\n\nIn this article, we’ll take a look at these essential site elements: the header, footer, hero, and menu. We’ll also discuss why each part is important and what information you should include for a successful website design.\n\nLet’s get started!\n\nWhat is the header site part?\n\nThe header part is located at the top of the web page and its content rarely changes. The header section typically contains the business title, logo, login information, and a menu, often with navigation drop-down links. You can use these elements to navigate to other parts of the website.\n\n\nThe header defines the color scheme for the whole website with a stylish heading and logo. The image below shows the header section from the Elementor website to give you some perspective.\n\nEvery site has a header, even Elementor!\nWhat is the footer site part?\n\nLike the header site part, the footer site part rarely changes. Unlike the header site part, , the footer section is located at the bottom of your website. The footer section contains content like links to various pages on the site and other information that you won’t change regularly. This can include copyright information, business details, resources, and career opportunities. \n\nFooters contain a lot of useful information and links to other pages or social media sites!\nWhat is the hero section?\n\nThe hero section is the first thing visitors see when they open your website. The hero section starts below the header section and contains content that you may want to change periodically. \n\n\nThe hero section contains images, videos, or animations that can encourage users to take certain actions, describe the benefits of using your product or service, or buttons that lead to the next page. \n\n\nNot every page of your website requires a hero section. A hero section is best suited for situations where you have to build trust or offer something to customers. In scenarios where a customer is visiting your website for particular information by typing a specific URL into their browser, you won’t want a hero section. In that case, having a hero section would only distract visitors.\n\nHero designs are not a “one size fits all” solution, so you’ll have to find your own style for your unique website.\n\n\nThe hero section often contains a call-to-action for the visitor!\nWhat is the menu? \n\nYou can find the navigation menu section at different places on the header depending on the style of your webpage. The menu selection often contains a collection of links like drop-down menus or list menus. \n\nElementor’s menu system is designed to keep the page clean. This leads to better aesthetics and helps users find what they need.\n\nElementor’s menu system hides navigation tools to keep the page clean!\n\nIf you want to create your website from scratch, both the Elementor Pro and the Elementor hosted website subscriptions come with the theme builder. \n\nNext, you may want to check out the Theme Builder to learn how to create essential site parts like the header and footer yourself or discover how to use the headers and footers available from the Theme Builder’s template library. Alternatively, discover how you can use a website kit with ready-to-use headers, footers and professionally designed pages. \n\nTo get the most out of Elementor, check out the Elementor Academy for more helpful learning resources.

You needed design skills to envision a page and programming skills to turn your vision into a reality.\n\nWith WordPress, you can build a beautiful, customized website for your blog,  photography site, portfolio, or even an eCommerce business–no coding required. One of the tools needed for this revolution was the WordPress theme. \n\nIn this article, we’ll go over the features and functions of WordPress themes. Let’s get started!\n\nWhat is a WordPress Theme?\n\nA WordPress theme is a collection of files– style sheets, images, graphics, and code– that determines how your website or blog looks and feels on the frontend. That’s what visitors see when they view your website. These themes giver your website structure and are a necessary part of any WordPress website. They underlie everything from the overall layout to the color of your buttons and your hyperlinks.\n\nIn contrast to plugins, which control the functionality of your WordPress site, themes control how the content is presented. If you want to change how your site looks periodically, it’s best to leave all the essential features to a plugin so you can preserve the functionality even if you switch themes. \n\nWhat can WordPress themes do?\n\nThemes help take the content and data WordPress stores and display it in the browser. You customize the actual content and data that’s displayed while the theme determines how it is presented. Of course almost all themes allow you to customize how things are displayed to varying degrees.\n\n WordPress themes allow you to:\n\nCreate a WordPress website\nPlace content on the page \nControl which devices and actions display your content\nInclude design elements such as images and videos\n\nWordPress themes are certainly powerful, but a great theme is much more than color and layout alone. The best themes improve user engagement while remaining beautiful.\n\nHowever, when you are working with themes, you can run into difficulties. For instance, when your vision of how you want your website to look or function clashes with what the theme allows.\n\nThis can be especially problematic for Elementor web creators. The tools Elementor provides allows creators almost unlimited possibilities to build exactly the site that they want, and many do not want to be constrained by a theme. However, to build a WordPress website, you must have a theme. \n\nTo solve this dilemma, Elementor created the Hello theme, to give creators the maximum flexibility possible. \n\nLearn more about the benefits of the Hello theme. \n\nFinal words\n\nNow you know what a WordPress theme is and why the Elementor Hello theme is the best to get you started on your web building journey.

Instead of designing pages, sections, containers etc. from scratch, you can use templates to implement your designs quickly and ensure a consistent look and feel across your site.\n\nIn Elementor, templates also refer to the standard parts (e.g. header, footer) of your website. \n\nTemplate or template?\n\nAs mentioned above, when working with Elementor the word template is used in two different ways:\n\nA standardized document that you can edit to suit your needs (e.g. a resume template will tell you how to format, and where to enter, your education, work experience, etc.). These templates are primarily saved and accessed through the Template Library. \nA primary document that will be replicated throughout your website (e.g. your website’s header and footer). In Elementor, we call these templates “site parts” and they are accessed primarily through the Theme Builder.\nExamples of templates\n\nAlex wants to create a hero section and reuse this design in hundreds of pages, only changing the words in the heading. They create the hero section and save it to the Template Library. Now every time they want to reuse it, Alex simply imports the template and changes the text.  \n\nFrancis needs a professionally designed page but doesn’t want to hire a designer. They open up the Template Library and find and import a pre-designed template created by Elementor, changing the text and images. \n\nJessie is building a site for Smith Construction and wants to design the header. They go to the Theme Builder and edit the header site part template, using the name Smith Construction. This header appears above every page on the site. A year later, the company changes its name to Smith and Sons.

WordPress was, therefore, originally designed for creating posts. Over time, web creators began using WordPress to create full-fledged websites, and pages became more important. \n\nIn this article, you’ll learn the differences between posts and pages. You’ll also learn when it’s best to use posts and when you’d be better off using pages.\n\nWhat are posts?\n\nPosts are used when you want to share information that changes frequently or when you want to share content on social media. If you have a blog that you update on a daily basis, each daily blog entry is a post.\n\nOrganization\n\nPosts will appear in reverse chronological order. That means your newest posts will appear at the top of the page, and your older posts will be located at the bottom.\n\nFeatures\n\nPosts come with numerous built-in features that allow you to make them interactive:\n\nComment section \nButtons to share the posts on social media \n\nPosts also have built-in features that allow you to organize them more effectively:\n\nAuthor credit (you can include an author picture or avatar and a short biography)\nPublication date\nCategories\nTags\nWhen to use\n\nYou don’t have to limit your posts to blog entries. Posts are also great when you want to announce new product releases or exciting information about your company, when you have time sensitive content, or when you have a schedule of events, etc.\n\nWhat are pages?\n\nPages are a great way to describe your business or organization as a whole. The most common pages are the Home, About Us, Contact, and Product or Services pages. You can also use the 404 page to let your visitors know they’ve tried to reach a non-existent page on your site.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe organization of pages is hierarchical with parent pages and child pages. Parent pages have characteristics that they pass down to the child pages, like the overall theme or just the location of it. \n\nFeatures\n\nPages come with no built-in features. If you want a specific feature on one of your pages, you can achieve that functionality by installing plugins. \n\nWhen to use\n\nIt’s best to use pages for static content that rarely, or never, changes.\n\nPosts and pages, a side by side comparison\nWhat are Posts?\tWhat are Pages?\n\nTime: Dependent\t\nTime: Independent\n\nOrganization: Reverse chronological\t\nOrganization: Hierarchical\n\nBuilt-in features: Numerous\t\nBuilt-in features:  None\nPosts and pages – a comparison\n\nNote: You may, at certain points, come across the term “Post Types”. This is a category definition in WordPress and is unrelated to the term “post” as we use it in this article. \n\nConclusion\n\nIn this article we’ve covered the key differences between posts and pages. You now know when it’s best to use them and are well on your way to building a stunning website! Next, you may want to take a masterclass on how to create blog posts or learn how to create a blog with Elementor. To get the most out of Elementor, check out the Elementor Academy for more helpful learning resources.

WordPress and Elementor work together to make coding a thing of the past, enabling anyone to quickly create a professional website. \n\nIn this guide, we’ll take a look at what WordPress and Elementor are and how they work together to save you time developing sleek professional websites.\n\nLet’s first take a look at WordPress.\n\nWhat is WordPress?\nWP Admin with the Elementor plugin installed.\n\nWordPress is a content management system (CMS) that simplifies the process of creating blogging websites. \n\nAt it’s core, it’s a user-friendly way to create the database underpinning your website without any need to know SQL, the standard database language.  In addition to being designed for non-programmers, WordPress is an open-source platform; meaning it’s free to use. This open source approach led to the growth of a large and thriving global WordPress community in which members create themes and plugins to help others build their websites, and extend WordPress’s capabilites. \n\nElementor is one such plugin that has found popularity within the community thanks to its powerful editing and site building tools – tools which make building professional WordPress sites even more efficient and intuitive.  \n\nDid you know? WordPress powers ~43% of all websites on the internet!\n\nWordPress.org\n\nWordPress.org provides you with the software to create your own website. It can be referred to as self-hosted WordPress because you are responsible for hosting or, in most cases, finding a third-party, to host your site. So while the software is free, you will most likely have to pay for someone to host your site. There are a few other limitations:\n\nNo drag and drop editing capabilities\nYou are responsible for backing up and maintaining your site\nYou are responsible for the security of your site\nWhere does Elementor fit in?\n\nElementor is a popular WordPress website and webpage builder plugin that brings its own tools to the WordPress world. Perhaps the easiest way to look at it is that WordPress provides a building’s framework, while it’s Elementor that lets you build the beautiful mansion resting on this infrastructure. \n\nOne of the key tools allowing you to build your “mansion” is the Elementor Editor. This visual drag and drop editor allows web creators to seamlessly build webpages capable of sophisticated, dynamic functionality. \n\nBy using the editor to drag and drop widgets onto your page, you can save time creating your masterpiece. It means working more intuitively, with no need to code in order to create a professional website.\n\nWith the Elementor Editor, users drag and drop widgets onto the canvas to create a page.\n\nWhile the Elementor Editor allows you to build beautiful web pages, the Theme Builder allows you to put these pages together to create an entire website. Using the Theme Builder you create headers and footers for your pages, templates allowing you to create uniform pages and posts and even a creative, fun 404 page designed just for your site.\n\nThe Theme Builder transformed Elementor from a webpage editor to a site builder.\n\nNot only that, if you don’t have the time, or inclination to design your own site, Elementor comes with a kit library filled with ready-to-use sites that you just need to add your own content to.   \n\nAlong with the free version of Elementor, there’s Elementor Pro, which is designed to give you more advanced professional features. These powerful tools include drag and drop ecommerce tools, embedded forms, and customizable features. \n\nIf you’ve had to code your own websites you know these features can take days to implement and test successfully. With Elementor and Elementor Pro, drag and drop means hours not days to complete a project. It also means you’re not worrying about how your code is working or how it might break.   \n\nThe bottom line\n\nWordPress was built, and does a great job of, holding the content of a website. Elementor was created with design in mind, making the process of building attractive, sophisticated, professional websites faster and more efficient. Drag and drop editing, the Theme Builder, the Kit Library, all combine to make Elementor a popular plugin to use on any WordPress website project. Elementor is a visual editor that keeps your workflow lean while providing you with a professional website when you’re done! \n\nHave more questions?

Which plan should I get?\n\nElementor Pro empowers you to build complete WordPress websites.\n\nThe Essential plan includes all the capabilities required to build a basic website. You will get access to 50 Pro widgets, the Theme Builder to edit the header, footer, and other theme parts. This plan also includes basic marketing tools using the Form Builder, so you can stay connected with your website visitors.\n\nThe Advanced plan includes 82 Pro widgets, and enables you to create ecommerce and professional websites. In addition to all the features available in the Essential plan, it also includes advanced marketing features like form integrations to integrate with your marketing software, the popup builder, ACF / CPT support for greater dynamic content support. This plan also includes ecommerce features with the full WooCommerce Builder, and integrations to PayPal and Stripe.\n\nWhat is the difference between the plans of Elementor Plugin and Elementor Hosting?\n\nElementor Hosting plans provide an end-to-end solution that includes all the features and benefits of Elementor Pro Website Builder plugin, along with managed hosting and WordPress installation, resulting in a seamless creation experience at a great value price. When building and hosting your website with Elementor Hosting you get a hassle-free experience that saves you time to spend building a beautiful website and managing all these services under one roof.\n\nOn the other hand, Elementor plugin plans allow you to utilize all the amazing features offered by Elementor Pro. To use it, you will first need to purchase a hosting service with a WordPress installation and then download and install the Elementor plugin.\n\nThe Elementor Pro Website Builder Plugin includes 4 plans: Essential for building basic websites with Elementor Pro, or the Advanced, Expert, and Agency, that include all of Elementor Pro’s features to build professional and ecommerce websites, and also enable you to use the license on 3, 25, and 1,000 websites respectively.\n\nHow can I change between the different Pro plans?\n\nYou can switch your Free or Pro plan at any time from within your Elementor account. In your Elementor account, click “Upgrade Now,” select the plan you’d like to switch to, and immediately get access to the new features. Your Elementor account can grow with you, as there’s always a plan to fit your needs.\n\nCan I transfer the Elementor Pro license key from one domain to another?\n\nYes. You can transfer the Pro license key by deactivating Elementor from your previous domain and activate it on the new one. For more details, see Transfer your license between websites. Switching it over is easy with no hassle or hidden fees.\n\nCan I migrate my Elementor plugin based website to the Elementor hosting?\n\nOf course. You can follow the following step-by-step migration guide to migrate your website, or contact our support to help you migrate your website to Elementor Hosting in no time, for free. During this migration process, your entire website will be transferred to a new Hosting subscription which is required before migration. It’s always recommended to backup and save a copy of your website for safety.\n\nYou can also use Elementor’s Import/ Export tool to export your existing website as a kit and import it to an Elementor hosted website. Please note that the tool has some limitations, which means you may be required to do additional work once the import process is complete.\n\nWhat payment methods do you accept?\n\nWe accept all major credit cards and PayPal.\n\nDo you offer a free trial?\n\nThere is no trial period but there is a 30-day money back guarantee with no strings attached.\n\nHave more questions?

If you try to exceed that number of installations you will receive an error message asking you to upgrade your plan. \n\nFor upgrading your plan, see Upgrade Your Subscription » Elementor.\n\nOther reasons why this could happen are:\n\nYou uninstalled Elementor Pro from a website and then reinstalled it \nYou changed the URL of a website built with Elementor Pro \nYou have already used your license on the maximum number of websites\n\nIn these cases, some of your activations may be counted twice. \n\nNote\nElementor Pro users can disconnect and reconnect licenses to five different domains. A notification appears on your My Elementor dashboard when you have two or fewer activations remaining.\nSolutions\n\nFollowing are the solutions for different causes:\n\nUninstalled Elementor Pro from a website and then reinstalled it\n\nElementor will see that as two separate activations.To correct this, you’ll need to deactivate the website and then reactivate it. Follow these steps:\n\nLogin to My Elementor.\n\nClick the Billing tab.\nThis brings up a list of your subscriptions.\n\nSelect the subscription containing the site you need to deactivate/activate and click Manage this subscription.\nFor the site you want to deactivate click disconnect website icon. This will free up the activation.\n\nLogin to the WP Admin dashboard of the website where you reinstalled Elementor.\nGo to Elementor > License.\n\nClick Connect & Activate to reactivate Elementor Pro for this site. The site is now using one activation instead of two. For more information, see Activate Your Elementor Pro License (Get Started).\nChanged URL and the system asks to upgrade\n\nIf you switched domain names for your site, Elementor may count this as two activations. To correct this, you need to deactivate Elementor Pro on the old domain and activate it on the new domain.\n\nNote\nDeactivating a site will not affect the live site.\n\nFollow the steps for deactivating Elementor the old website and reactivating it on the new website. It is already discussed in the previous solution.\n\nElementor Pro used on maximum number of sites\n\nYou may transfer your Elementor Pro subscription between sites, but there is a limit to the number of sites for which you can activate your subscription. If you have reached this limit, you need to upgrade your subscription. For details, see Upgrade Your Subscription » Elementor. \n\nHave more questions?

PCLZIP_ERR_BAD_FORMAT (-10) : Unable to find End of Central Dir Record signature.\n\nPossible causes\n\nFollowing may be the cause of this error:\n\nThe .zip file you’re trying to install does not use the correct file structure for a WP plugin.\nThe .zip file is extremely large and you’re reaching memory limits while trying to unzip it.\nThe most likely cause is that you may not have enough server space left on your web hosting account to install the plugin. To confirm this, try to upload another large file to your site (example: a large image or video file). If you’re not able to upload large files, then storage space is likely the issue. \nSolution for incorrect file structure for WP Plugin\n\nTo avoid this issue, always ensure to:\n\nInstall Elementor plugin from the Plugins menu on a site. \nDownload Elementor Pro plugin from my.elementor.com.\n\nFor further details, see I’m Having Trouble Downloading The Elementor Pro ZIP File. \n\nSolution for large .zip file\n\nIf the .zip file is large you will hit the memory space limit. Contact the hosting provider and ask them to raise the following to resolve this issue:\n\nMemory limit\nphp file upload limit\nSolution for space issue\n\nTo resolve server space issues, log in to your hosting account and check how much unused space you have. \n\nIf you are at, or near your maximum server space, do any of the following:\n\nDelete some files (unused themes, plugins, old backups or log files that are no longer needed).\nUpgrade to an account with a larger amount of storage.\n\nHave more questions?

This is most likely due to a change in the domain URL of your site (including HTTPS/SSL migration). Please deactivate the license and then reactivate it again.”\n\nPossible cause\n\nThis error can occur under the following conditions:\n\nYour site and WordPress domains (URL) do not match. This usually occurs after changes to your domain or SSL. \nWhen the domain listed in your My Elementor account does not match the domain you are trying to activate Elementor Pro from. \n\nExample: In your My Elementor account dashboard, your Elementor Pro plugin is activated for the site mysite.com. You try to activate your Elementor Pro plugin from the dashboard of my-site.com. In this case, you will receive a license mismatch error.\n\nNote\nFor Elementor Hosting users: If you’re using a version of Elementor and/or Elementor Pro older than 3.9, upgrading both plugins to the current version should resolve any license mismatch errors.\nSolution\n\nIn most cases, deactivating and reactivating your license solves the issue. Follow the below procedures stepwise to resolve the issue:\n\nVerify WordPress URL and Site URL.\nLogin to WP Admin.\nGo to Settings > General.\n\nMake sure the WordPress Address (URL) matches the Site Address (URL) exactly. To be sure, copy the site address and paste it into the WordPress address.\n\nDisconnect the Elementor Pro license from the site.\nGo to Elementor > License.\n\nClick Disconnect. This disconnects your license from the website.\n\nDeactivate the website in your My Elementor account.\nLogin to your My Elementor dashboard.\nFor the required website click on the three dots. A menu pops up.\n\nSelect View related subscription.

This is being used for their live website  – mysite.com. Alex, however, wants to use a development site to completely redesign the site. To do this, they create a subdomain dev.mysite.com and redesign the site there. Using Elementor Pro on this domain will NOT count as a license activation and they can continue using their one activation for the live site.\nWhat domains can be used?\n\nFollowing is a list of staging/development sites that won’t count towards your license activations – just replace “example” with your site name. Keep in mind that the domain name must match one of the following formats in order for it not to count as an activation.\n\nTLD (Top-level Domains) that are not considered as an activation:\n\n.dev (example.dev)\n.local (example.local)\n.test (example.test)\n.staging (example.staging)\n.example (example.example)\n.invalid (example.invalid)\n.lh (example.lh)\n\nSubdomains that are not considered an activation:\n\ndev.* (dev.example.com). This can also be implemented as:\nexampledev.* (exampledev.example.com)\nlocal.* (local.example.com)\ntest.* (test.example.com). This can also be implemented as:\n*.test.* (example.test.example.com)\nstaging.* (staging.example.com). This can also be implemented as:\n*.staging.* (example.staging.example.com)\nstaging[0-9].* (staging6.example.com).

But in many cases you’ll still need access to the site for maintenance and updating. The easiest way to do this is through a My Elementor account. With a My Elementor account you’ll be able to access the site right from your My Elementor dashboard. This will also allow you to access the Template library and other features.  \n\nConnecting you account\n\nIn order to connect your account, the website owner will need to add you to the website as a user and then you’ll need to connect to the site:\n\nHave the website owner create a new user, using the same email address you use for your Elementor account (If you don’t already have an Elementor account, use the email address you will be using for your Elementor account.). You’ll probably want the owner to add you as an Administrator, giving you maximum control over the site.\nAs part of the add new user process, you will receive an email with a link, inviting you to the site. Click this link, which will take you to the site’s WordPress dashboard..\nClick the Elementor tab.\nClick the Elementor tab to start the process.\nSelect Connect Account in the upper right corner.\nConnect Account can be found in the upper right of the screen.\nCreate an Elementor account if you don’t have one.\nLogin to your Elementor account. This will open the connect window.\nClick Connect to connect your site. This site will now appear as a card in your My Elementor dashboard.\nClick Connect to finish the process.\nFinal thoughts\n\nUsing your Elementor account to access client sites will save you time and effort, helping you manage all your client sites. That way you can devote more time to building sites rather than keeping track of them. \n\nHave more questions?

Sometimes users prefer to stick with their existing plans and in many cases Elementor allows users to maintain these plans. \n\nHow long can I keep my legacy plan?\n\nCurrently, owners of legacy subscription plans can keep their plans provided they renew their subscriptions annually. If you fail to renew a legacy plan, you’ll have to purchase a new plan under the new terms. It’s important to note that owners of legacy plans may not necessarily benefit from new features. For example, owners of an Essential legacy plan will not have access to new features available in higher tiered plans.  \n\nWhat happens if my renewal fails? \n\nIf you have trouble with renewing your subscription, please contact Elementor support for assistance. \n\nWill I still get support for the features I currently have in my legacy plan?\n\nYes, you can continue getting support for all the features available in your subscription plan. \n\nElementor Essential legacy plan\nWhat is an Essential legacy plan?\n\nPrior to December 4, 2023, the Elementor Essential plan includes access to all Elementor elements. On December 4th, the Essential subscription will be modified to be made more appropriate for beginner web creators and those who don’t need all of Elementor’s professional features. If you owned an Essential subscription prior to this change, you will not lose access to any elements and these elements will continue to benefit from future updates.\n\nWhat will happen to my existing Essential legacy plan? \n\nYour existing plan will remain as is, and you will get all new updates that are part of the new Essential plan. To enjoy any new capabilities that are added to features that are now part of a higher plan, you can upgrade to a higher plan. \n\nWhat updates will my Essential plan get? \n\nYour Essential plan will continue to get regular updates to existing features in your plan whenever available, this includes features and security updates. \n\nWhat happens if I stop paying for my legacy Essential license? \n\nIf you don’t renew your subscription upon expiration, you will lose your Legacy subscription. If you choose to purchase a new subscription at a later date, your new subscription will be subject to the plan and feature breakdown on the day of your new purchase. \n\nWhat happens if my renewal fails? Will I have to upgrade to a higher plan to have access to the same features I already had?\n\nIf you have trouble with renewing your subscription, please contact Elementor support for assistance. \n\nI am using a legacy plan, will I still get support for the features I currently have, even if they are not part of my plan anymore?\n\nYes, you can continue getting support for all the features available in your subscription plan.\n\nIs the new Essential Plan a different Elementor Pro plugin? \n\nThe Elementor Essential Plan is still part of the Elementor Pro plugin. Features in the Pro plugin will be available based on the plan you purchased.\n\nI have an AI Write legacy subscription, how does that work?\n\nFor information about AI Write legacy subscriptions, see Elementor AI – FAQs.\n\nHave more questions? We’re more than happy to assist.\n\nContact Support\nOn this page\nElementor legacy subscriptions\nElementor Essential legacy plan\nIs this article helpful?\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated Content\nWeb creation\n\nWebsite Builder & Hosting\nStatic Hosting + Builder\nPage Builder Plugin\nHello Theme\nDynamic Content\nEcommerce\nTheme Builder\nLanding Page Builder\nPopup Builder\nForm Builder\nWorkflow Optimization\nElementor AI\nImage Optimizer\nWooCommerce Builder\n\nPricing\n\nWordPress Hosting\nStatic Hosting\nPage Builder Plugin\n\n\nElementor For\n\n\nWeb Designers\nDevelopers\nMarketers\nAgencies\n\nResources\n\nHelp Center\nAcademy\nBlog\nAdd-Ons\nRoadmap\nDevelopers Website\nSupport\nWeb Creators Glossary\nIntegrations\nWeb Creator Stories\nMeetups\nAI’s Prompt Library\nWordPress Download\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nCareers\nFAQs\nAffiliate Program\nTrust Center\nMedia\nTrademark\nTerms & Conditions\nAI Terms & Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nWebsite Accessibility Statement\nOpen-Source Software Components\n\nElementor is the leading website builder platform for professionals on WordPress.

Please refer to Add a user for more information about adding users to your site.  \n\nNote\nTeam members must have an Elementor account associated with the email you used to invite them.  If they already have an account, they should log in. Otherwise, they should create an account on the redirected account creation page before they accept the invitation.\nBecome a team member\n\nYou can become a team member in someone’s Elementor Agency subscription by accepting one of their two invitations sent via email as a WordPress User of the site and the other as an Elementor team member.\n\nNote\nYou must have an Elementor account associated with the email you received the invitation to become a team member and log in.

You may consider transferring your subscription(s) for reasons such as business restructuring, change of ownership, completion of website creation requiring the need to transfer the subscription to the client, etc.\n\nNote\nThe Elementor plugin and Elementor-hosted website subscription users can transfer their subscriptions effortlessly when required.\nWhen transferring an Elementor-hosted website subscription, you transfer the website ownership. You may have to transfer the hosting credentials to the new owner even if the third party hosts your website.\n\nMulti-site subscription transfers\n\nYour Elementor Pro, Expert, or Agency subscription with all the connected websites can be effortlessly transferred to another individual or agency using the Transfer Subscription feature. The Transfer Subscription feature handles all website-related complex tasks involved in the transfer.\n\nHowever, you cannot transfer an individual site within a subscription if that subscription has multiple sites in it.  We are hoping to allow single-site transfer within a subscription in the future.\n\nNote\nThe new owner will need their own Elementor account.\nTransfer a subscription to a new owner\n\nTo transfer your subscription, follow the steps below:\n\nNavigate to your My Elementor Dashboard.\nThe Websites page appears.\n\nOn the left navigation menu, click Billing.\nThe Billing page appears.\n\nOn the card you wish to transfer the subscription, click Manage this subscription.\nThe selected subscription details page appears.\n\n On the upper-right corner of the page, click the  icon.\nThe dropdown list appears.\n\nClick Transfer subscription.\nThe Transfer your subscription to a new owner dialog appears.\n\nIn the Who is the new owner? field, enter the email address of the individual you wish to transfer the subscription to.\n\nNote\nThe new owner has to create an Elementor account if he does not have one.  You must ensure to enter the associated email address of the new owner that will be used for creating the Elementor account.\nRead the terms and conditions thoroughly and check the box I’ve read and understood these terms.\nClick Send invitation.\n\nThe invitation sent dialog appears.  You will also receive a confirmation email notification in your email address.\n\n\nNote\n\n• You can copy the invite link and send it as an attachment in your email.\n• If you did not initiate the transfer process, please contact our support service for assistance.\n\nClick Done.\n\nThe new owner will receive an email invitation with instructions to create an Elementor account (if they don’t already have one) and provide billing information for renewing the account.\n\nNote that the subscription transfer invitation is valid only for the next 5 days and will expire if not accepted by the new owner.\n\nWhat happens after the new owner accepts the invitation?\n\nOnce the new owner accepts the invitation via email, the Elementor verification process will commence to check if the new owner has\n\nAn Elementor account\nProvided billing details\nSet up a valid payment method\n\nUpon completing the verification process, your subscription gets transferred along with all connected websites. However, you can still view the subscription on your My Elementor dashboard with the status Transferred.\n\nThe new owner can view the subscription and all related websites on his dashboard.  The transferred subscription will automatically renew by default (unless the user deactivates the auto-renewal feature), allowing the subscription to renew with the new owner’s payment details on the next renewal date.\n\nNote\nWhen an Elementor-hosted website subscription is transferred, the new owner gets all the hosting credentials. You may have to transfer the hosting credentials to the new owner even if the third party hosts your website via your hosting provider.\nCancel a subscription transfer\n\nYou can cancel the invitation to transfer the subscription for many reasons.\n\nNavigate to your My Elementor Dashboard.\nThe Websites page appears.\n\nOn the left navigation menu, click Billing.\nThe Billing page appears.\n\nOn the subscription card with the status Transferring, click Manage this subscription.\nThe selected subscription details page appears.\n\nIn the notification message on the subscription detail page, click Cancel the invite.\nAlternatively, on the upper-right corner of the page, click the  icon.  In the dropdown list, click Cancel invite.\n\nThe confirmation dialog appears.\n\nIn the confirmation dialog, click Yes, cancel it.\nThe invitation canceled message appears.\n\n\nHave more questions?

You can upgrade your active Elementor Pro license on your Elementor account. When you upgrade, you need to pay for the cost of your new subscription – after being credited with the prorated amount left on your current subscription. Renewal of your upgraded subscription takes place one year after the upgrade.\n\nExample\nAlex bought Elementor’s Business plan (1 website) for $300 on January 1 to start a web creation business. Their business boomed, and on July 1 they decided to upgrade to the Scale plan (10 websites) for $720.\n\nThis means Alex would pay $570 ($720 for the Scale plan, minus $150 for the six months of the Business plan they did not use). Their Scale plan would last until July 1 the next year when it would need to be renewed.\n\n\nUpgrade subscription\nSign in to your Elementor account and navigate to My Elementor Dashboard.\n\nIn the left navigation menu, click Billing.\nThe Subscriptions page appears.\n\nTo upgrade your plan, click Upgrade.\n\nThe page to choose your next plan appears.\n\nSelect the plan to upgrade and click Upgrade Now. \nThe billing page appears.\nComplete payment\n On the billing page, review the billing information and click Continue.\n\nThe payment section of the page appears.\n\nSelect the payment method as Credit Card or PayPal. \nBased on the selection, provide the card details or PayPal ID to process the payment.\nClick Pay now.\n\nThe success message for your purchase appears.\n\nHave more questions?

The VAT rate charged is calculated according to your country’s regulations as determined by your billing address. Please make sure your billing information is correct. \n\nWe currently charge VAT for the following locations:\n\nIsrael\nEuropean Union\nwarning\nWarning\nMake sure your billing address is up to date. See below for more details.\nDeducting VAT payments\n\nEligible businesses in the EU can deduct VAT payments from their purchases. To deduct VAT, fill in your VAT number when you make your purchase.\n\nEnter your VAT number to deduct the VAT payment.\nNote\nYou must enter your VAT number upon purchase.\nNote\nVAT deductions are validated through the VIES system. If the system does not recognize the number as valid, you will receive an error message. You will have the opportunity to correct the VAT number.\n\nYou must enter your VAT number when you make your purchase in order to deduct the VAT. For future billing of existing subscriptions (such as renewals), you can also update your VAT number at the subscription level through your My Elementor Dashboard.. If you have more than one subscription, you’ll need to add your VAT number to each subscription.\n\nTo enter your VAT number through the My Elementor Dashboard:\n\nGo to the Billing tab or your My Elementor Dashboard.\nSelect Manage this subscription for the relevant subscription.\n\nClick the edit billing address icon. \nEnter your VAT number in the appropriate field.\n\nNote\nVAT deductions are validated through the VIES system. If the system does not recognize the number as valid, you will receive an error message.\n\n\nNote\nYou’ll receive notification of any VAT charges in your auto-renewal notifications.\n\n\n\nThis VAT number will be used when renewing your subscription.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhy do I have to pay VAT now when I didn’t before?\n\nAccording to EU VAT directives (Articles 358a to 369 Directive 2006/112/EC), Elementor is obliged to collect VAT for services purchased by users established in European countries. We have updated our tax compliance according to these new regulations.\n\nAm I eligible for an EU VAT exemption?\n\nYou can check with the VIES system to see if you have a valid VAT exemption.\n\nHow is the EU VAT calculated?\n\nThe VAT is based on product cost with the rate dependent on the country of your billing address. This amount is added separately from the product cost. When buying an item that costs $X, you will see a total of $X during checkout, with the VAT listed separately.\n\nWhen a valid VAT number is added in checkout, or in subscription billing information, no VAT will be added to the total charge.\n\nAre you going to charge me for previous years?\n\nNo! You will not be charged VAT for previous years. The VAT will be added only for purchases made after the new policy updates.\n\nNext Steps\n\nTo get the most out of Elementor, check out the Elementor Academy and our YouTube channel for helpful learning resources. If you come across any issues or need help, please contact our Support Center.\n\nHave more questions?

It powers the WordPress editor, and is a requirement for many themes, plugins, and third-party applications.\n\nEnable WordPress REST API\n\nThe WordPress REST API is enabled by default, however it can be turned off through the use of a plugin or an .htaccess file. If you’re seeing the message WordPress REST API Unavailable, then chances are that you have a plugin installed that disables it.\n\nSome of the plugins known to disable the WordPress REST API include:\n\nDisable REST API\nDisable WP REST API\nToolkit for Elementor\nREST API Toolbox\nWordPress WPO Tweaks & Optimizations\nPerfmatters\nClearfy Pro\niThemes Security\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list. In general, this is a feature included in Toolkit style plugins, especially those advertising performance or optimization tweaks. Since your published static site is completely static, such changes are unnecessary.\n\nWe recommend searching your plugin settings for a “Disable REST API” feature, and turning it off. Alternatively, it may be safe to completely disable the plugin from the Plugins screen.\n\nToolkit for Elementor\n\nThe Toolkit for Elementor Disable REST API feature can be found by navigating to Elementor > ToolKit > Booster > Code Cleaner > WP Core Files. Make sure that the Disable REST API toggle is switched to the off position.\n\nREST API Toolbox\n\nThe REST API Toolbox Disable REST API feature can be found by navigating to Settings > REST API Toolbox > General. Make sure that the Disable REST API checkbox is not selected.\n\nWordPress WPO Tweaks & Optimizations\n\nThe WordPress WPO Tweaks & Optimizations plugin disables the WordPress REST API, without any setting for re-enabling it. This plugin will need to be fully disabled in order to publish your Strattic site.\n\nPerfmatters\n\nThe Disable REST API feature can be found by navigating to Settings > Perfmatters > General. Make sure that the Disable REST API option is set to Default (Enabled).\n\nClearfy Pro\n\nGo to Settings > Clearfy > Code and make sure the Disable JSON REST API setting is off.\n\niThemes Security\n\nThe iThemes Security REST API setting needs to be set to Default Access.\n\nTo activate the setting, navigate to the WordPress Tweaks section on the Security > Settings page of your WordPress dashboard. Click the Configure Settings button.\n\nGo to Security > REST API, and from the dropdown, select Default Access.\n\nClick Save Settings.\n\n⚠️ If you find a plugin that disables the WordPress REST API but is not listed here, please let us know via our live chat.\n\nMy WordPress REST API is still unavailable\n\nIf you’ve ruled out the possibility of a plugin disabling the WordPress REST API, it is possible that there have been changes made to your site’s .htaccess file which also disable it.\n\nCheck this by accessing your site’s files via SFTP, and opening the public_html/.htaccess file. First, be sure you take a backup of your .htaccess file. Then, if any of the lines in this file include the text “wp-json”, try removing that line.\n\nIf you’ve completed the steps above and still see the WordPress REST API Unavailable message, please do not hesitate to contact us via our live chat so that we can assist you further.\n\nHave more questions?

Elementor Static Hosting doesn’t generally support Ajax on the static version of your site, so even if you were to follow the steps below, the form would forever remain in a sending status and never actually send the form submission. An example of an Ajax-dependent forms plugin is Ninja Forms.\n\nTo use Formidable (with Ajax turned off) and other non-Ajax form plugins like WPForms or Formidable and others that we do not offer out of the box support for, you’ll need to sign up for a backend form service and do a little configuration:\n\n1. Sign up for a third-party form backend service. We recommend Formbackend.com\n\n2. Create a new form with the backend service of your choice. After you create a form, you should see a action URL that you can copy such as:\n\nhttps://www.formexample.com/f/9c44b333339f44f7\n\n3. Create a form with your form plugin, if you don’t already have one.\n\n4. Visit the page on your WP site with the form. Right-click anywhere on the form, and select Inspect Element.\n\n5. Copy the form ID. If your form does not offer a unique ID this approach will not work.\n\n6. Go to Publish Site > Settings > Forms and copy the Form ID from step 5 into the “Form ID field. Copy the form backend service action url from step 2 into the Action URL field.\n\n7. Click Save Changes.\n\n8. Test your form on the WordPress site.\n\n9. Publish your site to static using the red Static Publish button in the admin bar.\n\n10. Test your form on your static site. You should receive a form submission to your email upon every submission, and see the form submission in your form backend service of your choice.\n\nOPTIONAL: You can customize the fields that appear in the submissions if the form backend service has the option. For example, in Formbackend, you can go to Settings > Map fields or Settings > Hide fields.\n\nOPTIONAL: In the form backend service you selected, you can create a redirect to a custom thank you page URL that visitors would see after submitting the form. Note: this may be a paid feature.\n\nHave more questions?

You can use a free Hubspot CRM account to collect your form data.\n\nStep 1 – Set Up Your HubSpot Account\n\nOnce you have signed up for a free HubSpot account, follow these instructions on how to setup your account:\n\nIn your HubSpot account, in the main navigation bar, click the settings icon.\nIn the left sidebar menu, navigate to Marketing > Forms.\nClick the Non-HubSpot Forms tab.\nToggle the Collect data from website forms to on to enable non-HubSpot forms.\nStep 2 – Set Up WordPress\n\nNow that you have your HubSpot account setup, follow these directions to connect it to your WordPress site:\n\nInstall the HubSpot WordPress plugin (or add the HubSpot code snippet manually to your site).\nGo to the HubSpot plugin settings by navigating to Hubspot > Settings, and sign in to your HubSpot account\nUse a WordPress form plugin like Formidable, WPForms to add a form to your site.\nPublish to your preview static site for testing\nFill out the form on your static preview site. (See Troubleshooting Tips below if your form does not submit correctly. HubSpot may have still captured the form submission).\nStep 3 – Check for Form Submissions in HubSpot\n\nIn our final step, make sure the HubSpot integration is working. Login to your HubSpot account and go to Marketing > Forms.\n\nFrom the Form type filter, select Non-HubSpot Forms.\n\nYou should see the form you submitted on your WordPress site listed. It may appear by a name matching it’s CSS class. You can rename the form for clarity.\n\nClick on the Form Submissions (it may show a 0 at first).\n\nThe submissions for that form in HubSpot is displayed.\n\nYou will receive an email when the form is submitted.\n\nConnect Form Fields to HubSpot Properties\n\nHubSpot automatically collects all of your form fields in the form submission area. However, there are some fields you may want to save to the visitor’s contact profile in HubSpot. For example, you may have a user enter in a custom User ID to a contact form that you want saved to their HubSpot profile.\n\nNote in the form submission below there is a warning sign next to the user_id field. This means HubSpot is not saving this data to the contact profile.\n\nTo fix this, first setup a custom profile property in HubSpot (here’s instructions on how to do this). Make special note of the Internal Name for the property you setup.\n\nThen open up your form editor and modify the field identifier to match the value in HubSpot. In the example below we are using the Divi Form Builder.\n\nNow when the form submission is saved, it will also save the data to the person’s HubSpot profile. Note there is no warning sign next to the User_ID value now, signifying it is saved to the HubSpot contact profile.\n\nTroubleshooting Tips\n\nSince many WordPress form plugins were not designed to work with static sites, you may experience some situations where HubSpot collects your form data, but the form does not look like it submits properly.\n\nTroubleshooting Ninja Forms – When submitted on a static site, a Ninja Form will continue to display the word Processing in the Submit button. To fix this, select the Submit button in the Ninja Forms editor and change the Processing Label to sent. This lets the user know the form has been submitted.\n\nHave more questions?

Below are the CF7 features supported by Elementor Static Hosting websites.\n\nIn this article, we will cover:\n\nWhat CF7 features does Elementor Static support?\nTrack the page someone filled out a form on\nView form submissions in your WordPress Dashboard\nRedirect to another URL after submission\nSupported features\nBasic fields\nFile uploads\nZapier integration\nView form submissions in your WordPress Dashboard\n\nNote: Contact Form 7 add-ons, extension plugins, or integrations with platforms like Mailchimp and Salesforce that require interaction with the WordPress database are not supported yet. However, you may use our Zapier integration, to connect to another platform find out more.\n\nTrack which page a user was on when they filled out the form\n\nIf you have a contact form in the footer of every page of your website, you might want to know which page someone was on when they filled it out so you could send them a tailored response.\n\nTo do this with CF7:\n\n1. Install and activate this plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7-dynamic-text-extension/\n\n2. Add [dynamichidden page-url “CF7_URL”] to your form.\n\n3. Click Save.\n\n4. In the Mail tab, add [page-url] to your submission email, and click Save.\n\n5. Test your form in WordPress.\n\n6. Publish your site to Live or Preview using a Full publish.\n\nView form submissions in your WordPress Dashboard\n\n1. In WordPress, navigate to Contact > Form Submissions.\n2. From the drop down menu, select the one of your forms.\n\nRedirect to another URL after submission\n\nBy default, Contact Form 7 redirects to the same URL as the form’s URL after submission. You can, however, make it redirect to another URL, such as a “thank you” page, after submission.\n\nThe simplest way is utilizing Contact Form 7’s custom DOM event to run JavaScript. The following is an example of script that redirects you to another URL when the wpcf7mailsent event occurs:\n\n<script>\ndocument.addEventListener( 'wpcf7mailsent', function( event ) {\n  location = 'http://example.com/';\n}, false );\n</script>\nEmbed this snippet into your theme’s template file.\nReplace the http://example.com/ in the code to the URL you want to redirect to.\nAfter the code has been added, run a Full Publish to your live environment.\n\nHave more questions?

On static sites, forms typically wouldn’t work, but Elementor has built support for one of the most popular WordPress form plugins, Contact Form 7. Therefore, now you can send form submissions to practically anywhere via Zapier.\n\nWith the Elementor Contact Form 7 integration with Zapier, you can send form submissions from your site to:\n\nGoogle Spreadsheet\nMailchimp\n Hubspot\nSalesforce\n\nAnd many more.\n\nLet’s get started!\n\nRequirements:\n\nContact Form 7 (CF7) plugin installed, activated and embedded on one of your pages.\nZapier paid account  \nConnect your Contact Form 7 form to Zapier\n\n \n\n1. Create a form with CF7 (learn more about supported CF7 features here).\n\n2. Log in to your Zapier account (or create a new one).\n\n3. Click the Make a Zap button.\n\n4. Search for Webhooks (available for paid plans) and select Webhooks by Zapier.\n\n5. Next, for Choose Trigger Event, select Catch Hook, and click Continue.\n\n6. Copy the Custom Webhook URL.\n\n7. Return to your WordPress site, and on the left-hand menu click Contact. Click the name of your form to edit its settings, then select the Elementor Static Integrations Tab and paste the Custom Webhook URL into the Webhook URL field. Then, click the Save button.\n\n8. Go to your page with the Contact Form 7 form embedded on it (either in WordPress front-end or on the published static site) and fill in the form with test data and submit it. Zapier needs this step in order to receive a sample submission so you can map the fields as needed.\n\n9. Go back to Zapier, click Continue.\n\n10. Click Test Trigger.\n\nYou should see the latest form submissions from your CF7 form in Zapier:\n\n12. Click Continue.\n\n13. Select another service to connect to (Mailchimp, Hubspot, Google Sheets, etc).\n\n14. Map the data from your form submission inputs to the web service you’re zapping to. For example, I connected my form to Gmail and mapped “Your Email” from Contact Form 7 to the Gmail mailto field:\n\n15. Once all your required fields are mapped, click Continue.\n\n16. You will now have an opportunity to test your integration settings. When you’ve completed your testing and are happy with the results, turn on your Zap. See Zapier documentation for details.\n\n17. Go back to your WordPress site, click the big red Strattic publish button,  click Full Publish to generate a static version of your WordPress site.\n\n18. Test the CF7 to Zapier functionality on your static site!\n\n(Optional) Trigger multiple zaps with Zapier Webhooks \n\nYou can combine multiple webhooks into a single URL if you want to run them from the same event in your app. For example, if you have three Zaps, the URLs would look like this:\n\nhttps://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123456/zbB61\nhttps://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123456/kzXC4\nhttps://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123456/2Ajjn\n\nThis can be done by taking the last portion of each URL and combining them into one:\nhttps://zapier.com/hooks/catch/123456/zbB61,kzXC4,2Ajjn\n\nRequests sent to this URL will trigger all three webhook URLs at once.\n\nHave more questions?

When using one of these plugins, Elementor’s servers send mail using an Elementor domain.\n\nIf you prefer to send from your own custom domain you could do so via your own SMTP server, just follow the below steps!\n\nFrom your WordPress dashboard, from the left-hand menu navigate to Publish Site > Settings > Forms.\nEnter your SMTP credentials, and click Save Changes.\nWhat is SMTP?\n\nSMTP, which stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, allows you to send emails via the internet from one email server to another.\n\nWhat is an SMTP server?\n\nThis is a server (or collection of servers) that is solely responsible for sending and receiving email.\n\nChoosing an SMTP Server\n\nFor businesses that send a large number of emails per day, a paid service is recommended.\n\nConsider these options:\n\nSendLayer\nSMTP.com\nSendinblue SMTP\nMailgun SMTP\nSendGrid SMTP\nPostmark SMTP\n\nConsider the send limits for each of these services and if they meet your needs. In cases where a paid solution is not necessary, you can also make use of open source and free SMTP servers.\n\nCan I use my existing SMTP?\n\nOf Course! If you are already using Gmail, Google Workspace, Outlook.com or Microsoft 365 to power your email, you can use their SMTP servers to send your email. Just be sure to check your provider’s send limitations to make sure they are appropriate for your needs.\n\nHave more questions?

Perfect for fixing typos or updating content quickly!\n\nThere are four places to find the selective publish option:\n\n1. In the Elementor Editor: From the Elementor Editor, mouse over the Static Publish button in the side panel, select the Preview or Live environment, and click Selective Publish to….\n\n2. From the WordPress Admin bar: When you’re on a post or a page, mouse over the Static Publish button in the admin bar, select the Preview or Live environment, and click Selective Publish to….\n\n3. From the side panel in the WordPress Block Editor:\n\n4. From the Admin bar side menu: Static Site > Publish Options:\n\n5. You can specify a list of URLs to be published. Navigate to the Publish Options page by going to Static Site > Publish Options in the side menu (or Go to Publish Options from Static Publish button in the admin bar).\n\n6. Select your environment (Preview or Live) and then scroll down to the Selective Publish section.\n\n\nHere, you can add a list of URLs to be published.\n\n7. All you have to do is enter the relative URLs in the text box and click on the “Add Publish URL” button to add more URLs.\n\n8. Click on the Selective Publish button to publish only those URLs that you listed to your Preview or Live static site.\n\nThat’s it! You updated your static site faster than ever! 🎉\n\nHow does Selective Publish compare to other publishes?\n\nThere are three publishing options, Selective Publish, Quick Publish, and Full Publish. The table below shows what will be published when using each of these options.\n\nKnowing your best publishing option will allow you to publish as quickly as possible.\n\n \tSelective\tQuick\tFull\nNew Posts\t❌\t✅\t✅\nEdit existing Posts\t✅\t✅\t✅\nNew or edited Pages\t✅\t✅\t✅\nDeleting/Trash a page or post\t❌\t✅\t✅\nSpecified File Paths\t✅\t✅\t✅\nBlog Archive\t❌\t✅\t✅\nArchives related to new/edited posts (Author, Tag, Category, etc.)\t❌\t✅\t✅\nDynamically updated content (Sitemap, RSS Feed)\t❌\t✅\t✅\nRedirections (via plugin)\t✅\nLearn how\t❌\t✅\nBuilt-in redirection of changed WordPress post permalink slugs.\t❌\t❌\t✅\nNew or edited Elementor Templates\t❌\t❌\t✅\nSwitching Theme\t❌\t❌\t✅\nTheme Changes\t❌\t❌\t✅\nSite-Wide Elements (i.e. Header, Menu, Footer, Widgets)\t❌\t❌\t✅\nAdding/Deleting Plugin\t❌\t❌\t✅\nChanging Plugin Settings\t❌\t❌\t✅\nChanging Site Settings\t❌\t❌\t✅\nSupported Forms: changing form settings (i.e. notifications)\tNo publish required\tNo publish required\tNo publish required\nSupported Forms:\nNew or Edited Form on one page (i.e. adding a field)\t✅\t✅\t✅\nSupported Forms:\nNew or Edited Form on multiple pages (i.e. adding a field)\t❌\t❌\t✅\nSite Migration\t❌\t❌\t✅\nAdding, editing or removing files via FTP\t❌\t❌\t✅\nFAQ\n\nWill selective publishing affect other pages on the site as well?\n\nIf you selectively publish a page, it will also publish any changes in the files used to build it, so things like JS files, CSS files, etc. If those files are used on other pages on your site, then it will change those too.\n\nHow do I selective publish a redirect to my static site?\n\nFrom the WordPress dashboard, go to Static Site > Publish Options, you will need to input the URL that you are redirecting from and click the selective publishbutton.\n\nFor example if /this-page/ redirects to /that-page/\n\nInput /this-page/ and then click the selective publish to live/previewbutton.\n\nIt is important to mention that if you have not yet published the new page that you are redirecting to (for example: /that-page/), then you should also add that path to the selective publish as well. This will result in both the old page and the new page being published simultaneously.\n\nHave more questions?

Make sure your category image is positioned in an area that will coordinate with the popup you design, as it will be an integral part of the entire animated effect.\nSet The Product Archive Templates’ Publish Options\nFor each template, set the Display Conditions to Include: Product Categories > search and select the relevant category for each\nDesign the Popup and Its Content\nGo to Templates > Popups > Add New and give your new Popup a name. (An alternative method is to press CMD+E or CTRL+E to open Finder, search for Popup, choose Add New Popup, and give it a name.)\nChoose a pre-designed Popup template or close the Library overlay and design your Popup from scratch. Because this popup will closely integrate with the design of the product archive templates, it’s best to design your own.\nDesign the popup content with the category in mind. Leave an area on the top of the popup with some blank space, so the archive template image can overlay it nicely.\nIn Popup Settings > Layout, set Entrance Animation to Slide In Left.\nIn Popup Settings > Advanced, set Disable Page Scrolling to Yes.\nSet The Publish Options\nGo to  Publish Settings > Conditions, and set Include > WooCommerce > Product Categories > search and select the relevant category.\nGo to Triggers and set On Scroll Direction to Down and Within 8% of scrolling. Of course, adjust the percentage to accommodate your design so that the popup coordinates with where you have your category image displaying on the product archive page.\nGo to Advanced Rules and set Show On Devices only to Desktop, since this design concept won’t work as well on laptop or mobile. You can always create different popups and design schemes for those devices if you choose.\nAdjust The Product Archive Template\nGo to Templates > Theme Builder to edit your product archive template that will be using this popup.\nEdit the category image widget and go to its Advanced tab, and set the Z-Index to 10,000. This will allow the category image to appear on top of the overlay and popup.\n\nRepeat the steps for each product category, creating a relevant popup for each. Ensure that every popup focuses on a product in the category that pairs well with the category’s image. Use Conditions to assign each popup you design to its product category.\n\nAll done. Now visit the live product category pages, and see how seamlessly your popups blend with your archives.\n\nHave more questions?

This helps you maintain a consistent look and feel. You can use one template for your entire site or create different templates for different areas of your site.\n\nThese single post templates are site parts and can be found by navigating to Templates>Theme Builder from the WordPress dashboard and selecting Single Post. Here you have quick access to add, edit, or delete any single post template.\n\nNote: A single post template is meant to apply a design to the post using dynamic information and not by adding content directly to the template.\n\nIf no Single Post Templates have been created yet, you need to create one. Click Add New in the upper right corner of the Single Post Site Part screen.\n\nOnce you’ve created at least one Single Post Template, you will be able to manage them here.\n\nEdit An Existing Single Post Template’s Design\nTo edit an existing Single Post Template, click the Single Post Template label in the sidebar. This will open the Single Post Template’s details dashboard.\nClick the Edit link in the upper right corner of the specific Single Post Template you wish to edit.

Elementor allows you to dynamically insert the Toolset custom field data directly into your Elementor designs with all the styling options you’ve come to expect from Elementor.\n\nHow To Add Toolset Custom Fields To A Single Post Template\nGo to Templates > Theme Builder > Single > Add New\nChoose Template Type > Single. Name your template and click Create Template\nClick on the Document Settings gear icon  located at the bottom left of the panel\nClick the Preview Settings tab\nUnder Preview Dynamic Content select the post type you wish to preview\nDrag a widget that makes use of dynamic content (e.g. Text widget)\nClick on the Dynamic icon \nChoose Toolset Field\nOnce selected, click again on Toolset Field\nIn Settings > Key, select the custom field you want to display.\nThe options in the Advanced tab are optional. Options include:\nBefore: Text to automatically appear before the custom field data\nFallback: Text to display if custom field has no data\nAfter: Text to automatically appear after the custom field data\nStyle the custom field widget as you would normally, using the widget’s Style tab.\nCustom Toolset fields we support:\n\nNote: Any Toolset fields not included in this list are not supported at this time\n\nText:\n\n‘textfield’,\n‘phone’,\n‘textarea’,\n‘checkbox’,\n‘select’,\n‘numeric’,\n’email’,\n’embed’,\n‘google_address’,\n‘wysiwyg’,\n‘radio’\n\nURL:\n\n’email’,\n‘image’,\n‘file’,\n‘audio’,\n‘url’\n\nDate: date\n\nimage: image:single\n\ngallery: image:multiple\n\nExample of use\nTeam Members\n\nA corporate website may want to display a list of team members.

In general, sites have one standard header used for every page on the site – although some pages on a site may not have a header or need a custom header.\n\nThe Header Site Part section of the Theme Builder lists all Headers you’ve created, if any, giving quick access to add, edit, or delete any header.\n\nIf no headers have been created yet, you will be prompted to create one. Click Add New in the upper right corner of the Header Site Part screen.\n\nOnce you’ve created at least one header, you will be able to manage them here.\n\nEdit An Existing Header’s Design\nTo edit an existing Header, click the Header label in the sidebar. This will open the Header’s details dashboard.\nClick the Edit link in the upper right corner of the specific Header you wish to edit. This will open the Elementor editor for that Header.\nEdit An Existing Header’s Conditions\nClick the Edit Conditions link in the bottom left corner of the Header you wish to edit. This will directly open the Display Conditions editor for that Header.\n\nNote: The Dot Display in the upper left corner of the Headerindicates which site parts are live (has Display Conditions assigned to it), and which are merely drafts (no Display Conditions have been assigned). A Green Dot indicates a live Header, while a Gray Dot indicates a draft Header. \n\nNote: The Instances label in the lower left corner of the Header displays the specific instances in which this template is being used on the site. \n\nAdd a header HTML tag\n\nThe header HTML tag identifies your header to screen readers and is an important part of accessibility.\n\nTo tag your header:\n\n\nOn the top bar, click the Header Settings icon.\n\nIn the panel, use the HTML Tag dropdown to select header.\nExport A Header\nClick the Three Horizontal Dots in the upper right of the Header you wish to export. \nChoose Export to open a Save dialog which will save a .json file to your computer.\nDelete A Header\nClick the Three Horizontal Dots in the upper right of the Header you wish to delete. \nChoose Delete which will open a Delete Part confirmation dialog box. \nClick Cancel if you change your mind and decide you don’t want to delete the Header, or click Delete to confirm that you do wish to delete this Header.\nRename A Header\nClick the Three Horizontal Dots in the upper right of the Header you wish to rename. \nChoose Rename which will open a Rename Part dialog box. \nEnter the new name and click Change to complete the rename process, or click Cancel if you change your mind and decide you don’t want to rename this Header.\n\nHave more questions?

It will be using four different widgets to best demonstrate how the flex properties can help you create headers that work across all devices without having to duplicate and hide as done in the past.\n\nThis tutorial will use several advanced flex properties such as Order and Size. You should have a basic knowledge of the Container properties before beginning this tutorial. The Site Logo, and Menu should also have been assigned and created.\n\nGetting started\n\nYou should begin by creating a new Header Template in the Theme Builder. You may close the library options and start from a blank slate.\n\nA Site Logo, Nav Menu, Search Form, and Menu Cart widgets are used to make this example. You may use the Social Icons widget rather than the Menu Cart if WooCommerce is not installed.\n\nAdding the parent container\n\nYou will now set the foundation of your Header by adding a Container. A Boxed width will be used for this tutorial but may be changed to Full if desired once completed if your design requires.\n\nAdd a new Container by clicking the + icon\nIn the Container Layout Tab, the default layout will be used in this tutorial\nExpand the Items properties accordion\nThe Direction property will be set to Row\nSet the Align Items property to Center\nThe Justify Content will be set to Flex End\nIn the Style Tab, a Background color will be chosen. Using Global colors will save time a better workflow\nIn the Advanced Tab a top and bottom padding is applied (example: 10PX)\nAdding the widgets\n\nThe widgets will now be added to the container. Four widgets will be used to best demonstrate the Flex properties of Order and Grow.\n\nWhy backwards? Once the Justify Content property is set to Flex End, it is easier to drag widgets in reverse order. The Site Logo widget will also be using the Grow and Custom Width properties to best fill the remaining space in the later steps. Once you have learned these properties, you may adjust your workflow as desired.\n\nThe Menu Cart Widget\n\nIn this tutorial a Menu Cart widget will be used as it is a common need of many websites. If you are not using WooCommerce, You may substitute the Social Icons widget for your learning.\n\nFrom the Widget Panel drag and drop the Menu Cart (or Social Icons) widget to the Container. It will use the Flex-End property of the container to be right aligned\nIn the Content Tab of the Menu cart, the Hide Empty, and Hide Subtotal are applied by using the toggle\nSet the widget’s Alignment to Center\nFrom the Style Tab, the Border is set to 0%. This will be inherited from the Button’s global styles\nIn the Advanced Tab, navigate to the Order Property. Click the Custom order option and enter a value of four.\nThe Search Form widget\n\nThe Header is a good place to keep a search option. You may use the Full Screen option of the Search Form to create a functional, but minimalistic design, search capability for your visitors. \n\nFrom the Widget Panel, drag and drop the Search Form widget to the left of the Menu Cart\nIn the Content Tab, select the Full Screen Skin option from the dropdown menu\nIn the Style Tab, set the Toggle Icon background color to best match your design. Global colors are used to improve the workflow\nFrom the Advanced Tab, set the Order property to three.\nThe Nav Menu widget\n\nYour website’s navigation may now be added using the Nav Menu widget. Your menus should already be created in WordPress.\n\nFrom the Widget Panel, drag and drop the Nav Menu widget to the left of the Search Form\nFrom the Content Tab set the Alignment property to Right using the icons\nIn the Menu Dropdown options select the Full Width option using the toggle\nFrom the Advanced Tab, set the custom Order property to Two.\nThe Site Logo widget\n\nYou will now add the Site Logo widget to the container. It should be previously assigned in the Site Settings. If not, you should do so now and then return to the editor.\n\nFrom the Widget Panel drag and drop the Site Logo widget to the left on the Nav Menu\nChoose the Left Alignment property by selecting the Icon. you may only see a slight change, this is normal\nFrom the Advanced Tab, the Custom Order property is set to One\nYou now use the Size property. Select the Grow option. This will allow the Site Logo to automatically fill the remaining space of the Container and will now be left aligned by inheriting the value in step two.\nResponsive mode\n\nYou will now learn to use the Custom Order property set in the widgets previously. This will allow you to change the order of each widget to best fit your design. This is a significant improvement over the reverse function previously available. It may allow you to avoid creating separate headers for each device. \n\nTablet View\n\nIn the Table View, the Nav Menu and Menu Cart’s Order property will be revered using the Custom Order property. In order for these properties to be used they must be first set in the Desktop View earlier. If you have not set the order of a widget to a custom value, do so before switching the device views.\n\nFrom the Container Layout Tab, adjust the width of the Boxed content (example: 90%)\nSelect the Nav Menu widget. In the Advanced Tab, you will now change the custom Order property to Four. Since the other items are inheriting their desktop view, it may not yet show in its proper location. This is normal\nNext select the Menu Cart (or Social Icons) widget. Set the custom Order property to Three\nFinally select the Search Form icon and set the custom Order property to Two (may already be in the correct location)\nThe Site Logo widget will retain the inherited Order value of One.  \nMobile View\n\nFor the mobile breakpoint, we will use the Wrap along with Justify Content properties of the Container. A Custom Width property is applied to the Site Logo to center it above the other three widgets.\n\nFrom the Layout Tab of the Container, expand the Items accordion\nApply the Wrap property by clicking the icon\nChange the Justify Content property to Space Between\nAdjust the Container Width property to allow for some left and right margin (example: 95%)\nFinally, select the Site Logo widget\nIn the Content Tab, change the Alignment to Center using the icon\nIn the Advanced Tab, change the Width property to Custom using the dropdown menu\nAdjust the width of the Site Logo widget to 100%\nCongratulations\n\nYou should now be able to create responsive Header Templates using the Container. You may now experiment with using different widget combinations and orders to wow your visitors.\n\nOptional social icons\n\nHere, the optional Social Icons widget mentioned in the tutorial above is shown to demonstrate.\n\nNext steps\n\nNow that you’ve seen how to build a Header template, check out how to build a template for the footer that will appear at the bottom of your site’s pages.  \n\nTo get the most out of Elementor, check out the Elementor Academy for helpful learning resources.

Each WordPress theme is built with templates. There is a template for the header, the footer, and other site parts. These are written in PHP and all inside the themes file folders.\n\nMost themes will have a template called single.php or singular.php. This file controls the main content layout. The above image shows the single.php used by the Hello theme. Without knowing much code, you may be able to see that it calls the post title, post content, page tags, and comments if used.  When you create an Elementor Single Page Template in the Theme Builder, it is over-riding your theme’s php file with the one you design.\n\nWhy is it important\n\nWhen needing to create many web pages on your site that retain a common design, the Single Page Template will save you time and let you focus on the content itself. You may choose to write in the WordPress editor or edit your pages with Elementor.\n\nAny new page you edit in Elementor will use this template as the new “Default” layout. Widgets will only be able to be dragged to the Post Content widget region without affecting the rest of the layout.\n\nNote: Setting a page or post to Elementor Full Width, or Elementor Canvas will override this template. Pages and Posts must be set to use the Default template setting in order to have this template applied.\n\nUsing templates for clients/staff\n\nSome designers/companies prefer to let their clients/staff only edit content using the WordPress Editor or by using Custom Fields. By creating a Single Page template, the page(s) layout can be retained when the content is being edited by others. \n\n“The Content” cannot be found. Help!\n\nWhen creating or editing a Single Page Template, the Post Content Widget must be used in your template. This is one of the common reasons you may see this error message when attempting to create or edit pages in Elementor. Other design elements may be placed “around” this widget. This widget connects to the database and retrieves all the content that is created when you create a new page in WordPress.\n\nHave more questions?

It is the most common error and is usually easy to fix.\n\nPossible cause \n\nThis error occurs when the preview of the page is not available.\n\nNote\nThe UI of your version may differ from the one shown in the video.\n\nThe error message may provide you with more information about the cause. For example, in the following image, you can click Preview Debug to verify that there is no redirect on the page.\n\nElementor can sometimes detect the exact issue in the following cases:\n\nNo Theme: Some of your theme files are missing.\nCorrupted .htaccess: ‘Your site’s .htaccess file appears to be missing.’\nHTTP Errors: format is <error code> <error message> content depends on the code.\nNote\nIf this message is received on a WooCommerce template or an archive page, such as the Blog page, this is normal. In this case, use the WooCommerce Builder or the Theme Builder instead of trying to directly edit these pages.\nSolutions\n\nTo fix this issue, try one or more of the following solutions:\n\nEnable Safe Mode\n\nFollow the procedures in What is Safe Mode?\n\nTheme file should exist\n\nMake sure the theme files exist. If no theme is available, install or re-install a theme.\n\nSite Address (URL) should be the same as the WordPress URL\n\nIf your URL in the back-end is different than the one in the front-end it can cause loading issues. These URLs can be checked in Settings > General. For more information, see Giving WordPress Its Own Directory – Documentation \n\nSelect Plain for Permalink structure\n\nFollow the below steps:\n\nLogin to WP Admin.\nGo to Settings > Permalinks.\nSelect Plain from Permalink structure.\n\nClick Save Changes.\n\nWhen using pretty permalinks, you should configure the web server (Apache, Nginx, LightSpeed, Microsoft IIS) as per the information provided in Using Permalinks.\n\nContact your hosting provider and ask them to configure your web server accordingly.\n\nEdit in incognito mode with your browser\n\nThis rules out any issue with an add-on or with the browser cache. \n\nIn Chrome, at the top right, click More > New Incognito Window. A new window appears. In the top corner, check for the Incognito icon indicating you are in fact in incognito mode. Now, navigate back to Elementor and see if the error persists. Also make sure no add-ons are working in incognito mode. You may, try a different browser altogether.\n\nSolve Rocket Loader issue\n\nElementor and Cloudflare integrate smoothly with each other. To solve integration issues, if any, refer Elementor And Cloudflare Rocket Loader. \n\nVerify that you do not have a redirect on the page\n\nYou can check this by clicking the Debug Preview button.\n\nIf you rename the index.php file or include anything else in its content other than the WordPress requirement, this will also result in this error. If you cannot edit your templates, look for “index.html” under your public_html folder and remove it.\n\nSolve hosting issues\n\nVerify with your hosting provider if your WordPress install includes the .htaccess file. If your .htaccess file is missing, you can regenerate it. For details, see Settings Permalinks Screen – Documentation – WordPress.org. Also, check with your hosting company if your server erases the PHP $_GET variable.\n\nHTTP Errors\n\nPossible solutions for different types of HTTP errors are listed as follows:\n\n403 errors\n\nYou may have a corrupt .htaccess file –  Follow the below steps to solve this issue:\nDownload your current .htaccess file to save as a backup. \nDelete it from your server.\nVisit your site. A new default .htaccess file will automatically be generated.\nIf this solves your problem, look at the .htaccess file you downloaded to determine if there is any code within it that needs to be corrected.\nYour file permissions may not be correct –  Ask your host to check that your WordPress directories and files have the correct permissions.\nThis can be due to a security plugin – To sort this out, activate the learning mode of the plugin or contact their support.\nThis issue can also be due to the firewall of your server, such as mod_security – Check this with your hosting company.\nAnother plugin may be causing a conflict – Follow the below steps to resolve:\nDeactivate all plugins except Elementor. \nPreview the site and check if the problem is resolved. If the problem is resolved, you know that one of the plugin is the problem. \nReactivate each plugin, one at a time, testing your site with each reactivation. \nKeep testing until you find the plugin that is causing the failure. \nGet in touch with that plugin’s developers to request assistance or use another plugin with similar functionality.\n\n401 errors\n\nThis issue occurs when you are attempting to access a page that requires authentication. If the page shouldn’t be asking for authentication, do the following:\n\nAsk your host to remove the authentication requirement.\nCheck any security plugins you may be using for options to turn this off.\n\n500 errors\n\nFor debugging, see I Get 500 Error While Using Elementor. \n\nHave more questions?

For details, see Create Or Modify Archive Templates » Elementor. Then, when you want to edit the page again, do the following:\n\nGo to  Templates > Theme Builder.\n\nOpen the desired theme.\n\nClick edit icon.\n\nThis opens Elementor for you to edit the page.\nError appears on WooCommerce pages\n\nIf you are trying to edit a WooCommerce shop or product page then they cannot currently be directly edited by Elementor. With Elementor Pro, however, you can create a new shop archive page to use in place of the default shop page. For details, see Creating A WooCommerce Shop Page / Archive Template With Elementor Pro. \n\nNote\nWooCommerce product pages must be edited with Elementor Pro’s WooCommerce Builder. Not doing so will result in error.\nError appears on Permalink and Slugs\n\nIf this is happening on a new page you are trying to create, do the following:\n\nLogin to WP Admin.\nGo to Settings > Permalinks.\nFrom Permalink structure, select Plain.\n\nClick Save Changes. This should resolve the issue.\n\nIf you are already using the same slug name for a post category or product category and then assigning the same name to a page, the permalink confusion can cause this error to occur. \n\nFor example, if you have a category with a slug of “sports”, do not use “sports” as the slug for your page. Give your new page some other name. This may resolve the problem.\n\nError appears on custom WordPress page template:\n\nThis error may occur for advanced users. If you or the theme’s developer have created a custom WordPress page template for your theme that does not include the_content function then you will need to include the_content in your code to edit it with Elementor or switch to a different theme. This may solve the problem. First, try switching to a theme like Hello and see if your problem is solved. If you are a web developer and are developing a theme, add the_content function into the page template’s code. Add the following line:\n\n<?php the_content(); ?> \n\nIf you don’t know where to place this code or how to add it to the page, contact your website developer to ensure proper implementation. \n\nNote\nAdding this code won’t enable the editing of Archive pages and Latest Post pages. These pages have to be edited using the theme builder of Elementor.\nImportant\nYou do not have to add this code if you are not the developer of a theme. The majority of WordPress themes include this function in the regular pages and posts.\nIssue with plugins\n\nDeactivate all plugins except Elementor and Elementor pro and check:\n\nIf this works, reactivate them one by one to find the plugin having issues.\nIf this doesn’t work, switch your theme temporarily to Twenty Twenty and see if that helps.\nSolution when error appears on all pages\n\nTry the following solutions:\n\nEliminate a caching issue: Clear the cache of your browser and check if it helps. This is relevant especially if it happens from time to time.\nEliminate an incompatible theme issue – Switch to an Elementor-compatible theme.\nEliminate a browser add-on conflict: Switch to another browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Opera) and see if the issue is fixed.\nEliminate a plugin conflict: Deactivate all your plugins besides Elementor and Elementor Pro to check if it removes the error message and if it is the case, reactivate them one by one to find the culprit.\nEliminate permission conflicts: To rule out issues of conflict between Elementor and Membership plugins, temporarily deactivate your membership plugin.\nEliminate server issues: Contact your hosting provider to eliminate .htaccess file issues, PHP $_GET variable issues, or zlib.output_compression module.\n\nHave more questions?

It helps in ruling out any caching or outdated data problems that might be causing the issues\nPerformance Optimization: Regenerating CSS and data can be part of performance optimization.

Check the following:\n\nPHP version\nMemory limit\nIncrease memory limit\nLogin to WP Admin.\nGo to Elementor > System Info. \nUnder WordPress Environment, check Memory Limit.\n\n\nIncrease the Max Memory limit to 512M if using additional resource heavy plugins such as WooCommerce. This is the most common cause of loading issues.\n\nFollowing are the ways to increase the memory limit:\n\nGo to cPanel, use the MultiPHP INI Editor for memory limit and other settings.\n\nEdit your wp-config.php file – Add this to the top, before the line that says, “Happy Blogging”:\ndefine('WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT', '512M');\nNote\nWordPress memory can be different from the server – you need to set this regardless of server memory settings.\nEdit your PHP.ini file – If you have access to your PHP.ini file, change the line in PHP.ini. If your line shows 64M try 256M:\nmemory_limit = 256M ; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (64MB)\nEdit your .htaccess file – If you don’t have access to PHP.ini try adding this to an .htaccess file:\nphp_value memory_limit 256M\nUpdate Elementor version\n\nYou should use the most updated versions of Elementor/ Elementor Pro, WordPress and your theme. Check for updates regularly by following these steps:\n\nLogin to WP Admin.\nGo to Dashboard > Updates.\n\nClick Check again to be sure.\n\nResolve plugins conflict\n\nDeactivate all of your plugins except the following:\n\nElementor\nElementor Pro\n\nIf this solves the problem, reactivate each plugin one by one, until you spot the problematic plugin. If found, contact that plugin’s developers for help, or use a different plugin.\n\nResolve issues with theme\n\nSwitch your theme (temporarily) to a default WordPress theme, for example, Twenty Seventeen, to see if your theme is causing an issue. If so, contact the theme’s developers for help, or use a different theme.\n\nOther issues\n\nIf the problem persists, ask your hosting company the following:\n\nProvide you with ModSecurity error logs and resolve any problems from it. \nEnable the PHP Zlib extension on your server, if it is not already.\nIncrease the value of max_input_vars.\n\nIf your entire Elementor screen does not load, rather than just the Widgets Panel, see Can’t Edit With Elementor.\n\nHave more questions?

The URLs should now begin with https and your fonts should appear on the front end.\nIf this is still not working, you may have encountered other issues when you previously migrated to HTTPS.\nNavigate to Elementor > Tools > Replace URL.\nIn the right pane, locate the Update Site Address (URL) section.\nIn the old URL field enter the site URL with HTTP. \nin the New URL field enter the site URL with HTTPS.\n\nClick Replace URL.\nScroll down and click the Save Changes button.\nNavigate to Settings > General.\nEnsure that the WordPress Address (URL) and the Site Address (URL) begin with https.\n\nCORS Error in Console\n\nIf your custom font is not showing and you receive a CORS error in your browser console, ask your hosting company to modify the server’s CORS policy. \n\nFor more details, see:\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy\nhttps://htaccessbook.com/increase-security-x-security-headers/\nImporting Templates\n\nIf you imported a template that included custom fonts, you need to add the custom fonts manually. Template fonts are not imported automatically.\n\nSelected font weight is not available\n\nCustom fonts may not have all available font weights available. If you select a specific font-weight in Typography options, but your custom font does not have that specific weight available, it may not display that font at all. In this case, select a different font weight that is available for your custom font. You may need to consult the font designer for this information.\n\nInvalid Custom Code\n\nIf you add invalid custom CSS or other code it can lead to many different display problems, including the inability to display custom fonts. Remove or fix the improper code to solve this issue.\n\nAll Font variations not included\n\nDifferent devices/browsers may need different font variations. For example, if fonts are not displaying on iOS devices make sure you have uploaded all font variations, including .ttf .svg .woff .woff2 and .eot\n\nIf any variations is missing then either of the following can happen:\n\ndefault font is displayed\ntext will not appear on the website\n\nThis happens because different browsers render fonts differently, so to prevent any inconsistencies, it is important to add all font variations to maintain full browser support.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the generator tool from Font Squirrel.\n\nHave more questions?

It:\n\nhelps identify any issue that interferes with Elementor loading. In most cases, loading issues are caused by conflicts between plugins or themes. \nlets you verify if the problem persists even after deactivating plugins and themes, and pinpoint the possible cause of the issue.\n\nThe only thing that changes when Safe Mode is enabled is that the Elementor Editor loading is done without any activated Plugins or Themes. Enabling Safe Mode also temporarily deactivates all Elementor Experiments.\n\nUsing Safe Mode opens the Elementor Editor on a clean version of WordPress, without loading a theme or any plugins. All plugins are deactivated and an empty theme file is loaded.\n\nNote\nSafe Mode removes third-party scripts from the Editor, however, it does not remove 3rd-party scripts from the Widget Panel.\nSolution\n\nFollow these steps to enable safe mode:\n\nLogin to WP Admin.\nGo to Elementor > Tools.\nSelect Enable for Safe Mode.\n\nClick Save Changes.\nThe Editor loads with the Safe Mode enabled.\nIf the Editor does not load, a pop up will appear on the bottom right. \n\nClick Enable Safe Mode.\n\nWhen Safe Mode is ON, you get the following message on the bottom right of the page:\n\nNote\nSafe Mode can be activated only by site admins (users with administrator privileges).\n• If you don’t see the option to enable Safe Mode, ask your site administrator to activate the safe mode and troubleshoot the problem for you.\n• For multisite setup, only Super Admins can activate Safe Mode.\nNote\nSafe Mode only affects logged in users while they are using the Elementor Editor.\n• Safe mode has no effect on site visitors or other logged-in users.\n• For other users and visitors, the site will operate as usual with the regular theme and plugins activated.\n\nNote\nSafe Mode only helps solve problems with the Elementor Editor itself.\n• It does not help solve issues that prevent the widget panel from loading or issues occurring on the front end of the site, such as changes that do not appear online.\nImportant\nSafe Mode must be disabled for Elementor experimental features to work. If missing functionalities (example: Landing Pages), disable safe mode.\nRelated articles\nFor details on debugging Safe Mode, see Debugging With Safe Mode. \nIf debugging with Safe mode does not resolve your issue, see Safe Mode Activation Isn’t Solving My Problem | Elementor. \n\nHave more questions?

We couldn’t deactivate all of your plugins on Safe Mode.\n\nThis message means that Safe Mode is unable to deactivate all of the plugins installed, especially when there are MU (must-use) plugins installed. For details on MU plugins, see Must Use Plugins.\n\nPossible cause\n\nDeveloper or a hosting company may implement one or more MU (must-use) plugins. This causes the issue.\n\nSolution\n\nDeactivate any MU plugins via your server’s control management panel or contact the hosting provider to deactivate it for you.\n\nNote\n• Safe Mode can still help diagnose the problem, unless you manually deactivate MU plugins. These plugins will still be activated and will not be part of the troubleshooting process.\n• Safe Mode can be activated only by site admins (users with administrator privileges), because only they can deactivate plugins. If you don’t see the Enable Safe Mode option, ask your site administrator to activate safe mode and troubleshoot the problem for you. For multisite setup, only Super Admins can activate Safe Mode.\nRelated articles\nFor details on debugging Safe Mode, see Debugging With Safe Mode. \nIf debugging with Safe mode does not resolve your issue, see Safe Mode Activation Isn’t Solving My Problem | Elementor. \n\nHave more questions?

Two popular WordPress LMS plugins, LearnDash and LifterLMS, both offer integrations with Elementor to help you style your courses the Elementor way.\n\nNote: Each LMS may offer different levels of customization, and you may only be able to edit certain pages or portions of the LMS layout.\n\nLearnDash: Elementor and LearnDash worked together to create an integration that results in an optimized, more accessible learning experience for your students. LearnDash has specific Elementor widgets and templates to make it easy for you to customize and style your LMS layout. For more information:\n\nSee our blog post for a full guide to setting up LearnDash with Elementor\nSee a guide that LearnDash created here\nWatch a video tutorial here.\n\nThe integration is contained within an additional free Compatibility Add-On Elementor Integration plugin that you’ll have available to you within your active LearnDash account.\n\nLifterLMS: Special widgets designed for Elementor enables LifterLMS users to have more control over the style and layout of their course materials. These widgets are contained within an additional premium plugin called Lifter Elements. If you choose to purchase the Creator edition, you’ll also receive additional functionality such as conditional logic, as well as all available specially designed templates. If you prefer, you can purchase templates individually if you only purchase the Standard edition. Watch an intro video to see how LifterLMS works with Elementor.\n\nHave more questions?

New versions not only introduce new features, but they also fix bugs that may exist in previous versions. In addition, all WordPress plugins that aren’t regularly updated may become security problems in the future. \n\nCurrent settings should not be affected in any way by an Elementor update.\n\nThe majority of the time, updates just work, and are beneficial. However, we highly recommend that you test the updates on a staging website before updating your live sites!\n\nYou should also back up your websites on a regular basis to avoid pitfalls. Updates are always tested on our end and by BETA testers but we cannot guarantee that there won’t be issues with some specific environments.\n\nMost of the issues following updates are indeed not linked to the code added but rather to issues with specific environments, such as installs with conflicting plugins and themes or with server settings which prevent Elementor from working properly.\n\nHave more questions?

We welcome you to  join the team of localizers and help translate Elementor to your language. Here’s how to easily translate Elementor into other languages. You don’t have to download any software, all translation is done online using the GlotPress platform. If Elementor has already been translated 100% to your language, we encourage you to still join the translation team, so you can help with translations in the next versions, or so you can improve the current translation.\n\n\n1. Log in to WordPress.org\n\nGo to the WordPress login page and login to WordPress using your username and password. If you don’t have an account yet, go ahead and create it, and on the way give us a 5-star rating 🙂\n\n2. Enter the translation page\n\nNow go to the plugin translation page, and search for your language.\n\n3. Choose a string to translate\n\nChoose a string you wish to translate. You can also methodically go over each string and translate the whole plugin, but this could take you a while, there are currently 31 pages of strings to sift through.\n\n4. Enter your translation and submit\n5. Translate placeholders\n\nSome strings you’ll need to translate will include placeholders. You have to include the placeholder in your output.\n\nFor example: Edit {0}\n\nIf you were translating to Japanese, you would translate like so: Modifier {0}\n\n“I finished translation, now what?”\n\nRecently. WordPress has changed the way the translation process works. You no longer need to upload any PO files, or do any technical thing for that matter. \n\n\nAll you have to do is send us a mail once you’ve finished translating to support@elementor.com and let us know about your translation, so we can get it approved by your language editors. The translation has to go through an approval process, so you can expect to see it after a few days.\n\n6. Update your site’s translations after each update of Elementor\n\nUpdating Elementor does not automatically update the translation. When you switch the language from ” Settings > General“, this changes the language of Elementor and Elementor Pro as well. But there is an additional step to take. \n\nGo to “Dashboard > Updates” and accept the translation of Elementor Pro there by clicking the Update Translations button. \n\nNote: After each update, there may be new strings to translate, so you should check the Dashboard > Updates panel after each Elementor update.\n\nGo ahead and translate Elementor now. You can learn more about joining the translation team on GlotPress. \n\nFor any further questions, ask us on the GitHub project.\n\nNote: For the translation of Elementor pro elements into your native language, please contact our support: translators@elementor.com\n\nHave more questions? We’re more than happy to assist.\n\nContact Support\nPrev\nPREVIOUS\nBecome a Beta tester\nNEXT\nSystem Information\nNext\nOn this page\n1. Log in to WordPress.org\n2. Enter the translation page\n3.

Our developers are highly trained to write safe, secure code, and we monitor for vulnerabilities. However, as with all software, even with the level of expertise and scrutiny that we employ, vulnerabilities can sometimes occur. As such, there are things that every web creator should know and do to keep their websites as secure as possible. \n\nHow does Elementor prevent security issues from happening?\n\nWe have specialized professionals who continuously monitor for potential issues. In addition, we may be notified by people in our community channels, findings from security software makers, and of course our own testing procedures.\n\nDo security issues happen often? \n\nFortifying security is a continuous process, not just a single effort. Whenever we identify a threat, we always remain vigilant and release a fix as soon as possible.\n\nWhen we first discover a security vulnerability, we start by examining it and understanding it from each angle. In order not to jeopardize our users before issuing the fix, we keep the reported issue discrete. Once we issue the fix, we can go on to inform users about the vulnerability and its resolution.\n\nWhat can I do, in general, on my end to prevent security issues from happening?\n\nOne of the most important steps you can take is to keep WordPress and your plugins up to date, as this will help ensure that any security patches are applied. Other steps include changing your password from time to time, considering the use of security plugins, and being mindful that you only use plugins and themes from known sources such as the WordPress.org repository and established companies that have a strong history of providing quality products. Avoid installing “nulled” plugins and themes as these often contain malicious code, and only keep plugins and themes on your site that you are actively using. \n\nHow do I report security bugs to Elementor?\n\nNot only does Elementor encourage reporting security bugs, we offer rewards to people who report particularly important issues. Report a bug or find out more about this program at our Bug Bounty page.\n\nHow do I know if and when the security issue has been contained or fixed?  Where do I go for the latest updates about security issues?\n\nFollow our social media channels and especially our communities. It will be mentioned there, in our changelog, and when relevant, in a separate email. Please make sure to create an account to receive important updates like these.\n\nWhy doesn’t Elementor send me a message the moment a vulnerability happens?\n\nWe do not want to alert abusers to a problem which could cause them to take advantage of the issue. We focus our efforts on getting a fix out there as soon as possible. When the issue is contained, we quickly inform our users via several channels, including email.\n\nI have an old version of Elementor Pro which was not renewed. Am I still safe?\n\nAlways upgrade to the latest version of Elementor. This advice may be applied to nearly all software. New versions contain security updates, bug fixes, and offer new features. If you want to test a new version before updating your live site(s), we recommend creating a staging area.\n\nHave more questions?

Wouldn’t it be great if you could just customize elements so that whenever you used them, they would be created to your specifications? Now you can with Elementor’s new Save as Default feature. \n\nExample: Alex’s website uses the Pridi font in green for headers. This means every time Alex creates a header she has to change the color and typography of the text. By changing the default settings of the Heading widget, every time Alex uses the widget, it will start with the Pridi font in green.\n\nNote: Save as Default is an experimental feature, you may have to activate it. \n\nNote: Once you change the default settings for an element, there is no automatic way to revert to the original default settings. The only way to return to the original is to create an element, manually change the settings back to their original values, and then save that element as the default.\n\nChanging the default settings\nDrag an element to the editor canvas.\nChange the settings as desired.\nRight-click on the element’s handle. \nRight-click the handle to open the menu.\nSelect Save as Default from the dropdown.\nSelect Save as Default to turn the element’s settings into the default settings.\n\nNow, every time you use this element, these will be the default settings. \n\nMore examples of saving default setting for elements\nCreate a section or container with a background image you like and Save as Default. Now all the sections/containers on your site will have a standard background.\nHelp guide your copywriters by changing the default text of text-based widgets such as changing the default text of the Heading widget to, “ Good headers are short.”\n\nCreate a button with the exact color, font and padding that you think is ideal and Save as Default. Others won’t have to recreate your button, it will be their default. \n\nHave more questions?

However, some websites may have a configuration that causes slow loading.\n\nSpeed test\n\nRun the following test to find the cause of slowness:\n\nCheck your website speed on page speed analyzers such as:\nGoogle Page \nSpeed Insights\nGTmetrix\nDeactivate all plugins besides Elementor and Elementor pro and verify if it improves the page speed.\nSwitch to the Hello theme.\nCreate a page with the Canvas template and test it for speed again.\nAfter following these steps run a speed test and check for improvements.\nHosting Servers\n\nFollowing factors have major effect on the speed:\n\nMemory limit\nDelete some files (unused themes, plugins, old backups or log files that are no longer needed).\nUpgrade to an account with a larger amount of storage.\nBandwidth\nContact your hosting provider to upgrade your package.\nLocation of the server in relation to the user\nUse a content delivery network (CDN).\nChoose a hosting service provider who have servers with global reach.\n\nFree or shared hosting services often cause poor speed. \n\nMedia (images, videos)\n\nImages slow down the website, especially if placed in areas that are always loaded, like the header and footer. Following are the tips to optimize slowness due to media:\n\nDo not upload large-sized images. \nKeep the size of images under 1 MB. \nUse images in WEBP format.\nUse Lazy Loading if you have many images on a page. For details, see Lazy Loading. \nUse third-party tools to reduce the size of your images. For example, TinyPNG. \nUse CDNs and external links for videos. \nUse the Elementor’s video widget option for loading videos from external sources like YouTube or Vimeo, instead of WordPress library. For details, see Video Widget.\nNote\nElementor blocks private videos and does not support YouTube shorts.\nExternal scripts\n\nUse of external scripts, for example, Google Maps, Facebook share count, Avatar images, considerably slows down a page load.\n\nExternal fonts\n\nYou can deactivate Google Fonts, Font Awesome, and Icons for example, by adding the following lines of code to your functions.php file in your child theme.\n\nThird-party fonts\tCode to add\nGoogle Fonts\tadd_filter( 'elementor/frontend/print_google_fonts', '__return_false' );\nFont Awesome\tadd_action('elementor/frontend/after_register_styles',function() {\nforeach( [ 'solid', 'regular', 'brands' ] as $style ) {\nwp_deregister_style( 'elementor-icons-fa-' . $style );\n}\n}, 20 );\n\nNote: By default, Font Awesome icons load only on the pages where they are used. This improves performance and site load speed.\n\nOnly the CSS and fonts of the icon family you actually use are loaded. \n\nDequeue Font Awesome if you do not want to use any Font Awesome icons at all. If you dequeue Font Awesome, the icons will no longer show on any of your pages.\nEicons\tadd_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'disable_eicons', 11 );\nfunction disable_eicons() {\nwp_dequeue_style( 'elementor-icons' );\nwp_deregister_style( 'elementor-icons' );\n}\nPlugins\n\nPlugins make WordPress slower. If you are not using a certain plugin, delete it.\n\nThemes\n\nA well-coded theme uses scripts and methods to reduce its file sizes. Switching between themes and seeing the effect might give you a good indicator if the theme is causing the slowness.\n\nYou may disable the themes and check the performance. If you find a third-party theme is causing the slowness, then contact the third-party theme builder support for help.\n\nUsing the Hello theme is advisable. For details, see What Is The Elementor Hello Theme? \n\nIf you want to write your own code inside the themes, see Elementor Developers.\n\nSpeed optimization\nUse a caching plugin like WP Rocket and Autoptimize or any other cache plugin that will meet your needs.\nUse a CDN service like CloudFlare.\nCheck with your hosting provider regarding possible causes of the site being slow on the server side.\nSwitch editor loader method. For details, see Settings » Elementor. \nReduce image sizes.\nCheck the ping speed of your servers and analyze the various elements’ loading time to pinpoint the cause of the slowness.\n\nTo learn about Elementor’s initiative to improve performance, see How Elementor Improved Asset Loading and Made Your Website Run Faster.\n\nHave more questions?

Each beta tester will be running under a unique server setup, with varied combinations of plugins, themes, and custom code, all of which helps us understand which types of configurations may present issues that we can resolve before release. \n\nBeta testing is especially useful for website developers & designers, as well as plugin developers, as they are able to test the compatibility of their plugin or website with the upcoming version of  Elementor.  \n\nBeta user feedback plays an important role in our ability to improve Elementor.  Feedback about any Issues should be reported in the relevant Github thread.\n\nImportant! We recommend only beta testing on a development or staging site, as beta versions are not stable and may break a live production site.\n\nHow To Enable Beta Testing Mode\nGo to Elementor > Tools > Version Control and look for the section labeled Become A Better Tester\nBeta Tester: Select Enable to be notified whenever a new beta version of Elementor or Elementor Pro has been released. \nAfter enabling, go to Dashboard > Updates and click the Check Again button to make the latest beta version available to you. All subsequent beta update notifications will show up on the Plugins admin page as normal. \n\nNote: The Beta version will not install automatically. You always have the option to ignore the update notification.\n\nHave more questions?

Elementor, however, does not have this issue, therefore, no disabling is needed. \n\nSummary\n\nElementor eliminates unnecessary asset-loading bloat, allowing your site to load faster, by only loading those assets necessary for the specific page being loaded.\n\nHave more questions?

The WordPress Export / Import tools will help migrate the additional content. It is important to install any dependent plugins on your new site before starting the migration.\n\nTip\nThe Migrate Guru plugin is a quick, efficient way to migrate your site. For more details, see Migrate your site to Elementor Hosting.\nImportant\nUsing third party migration plugins such as All In One Migration, Duplicator, or others is not recommended for migrating your existing site to Hosted Elementor Websites as they may overwrite the Elementor Pro Subscription connection.\n\nIf this happens, you may use the Hosted Elementor Website backup restore tools to restore your original connection.\n\nExport data\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nLogin to WP Admin.\nGo to Tools > Export. The Export window opens.\n\nChoose the content you want to export.\nFor smaller sites, you may choose All content. \nFor Posts and Pages, you may additionally filter the content you wish to export. \nIf you use additional plugins such as WooCommerce, you will see additional export options for those listed here.\nFor larger sites, break the process into separate files to avoid server timeouts.\nClick Download Export File.\nImport data\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nLogin to WP Admin.\nGo to Tools > Import. The Import window opens.\n\nFrom the list on Import window, install the WordPress.\n\nClick Run Importer. The Import WordPress window is displayed.\n\nChoose your XML file to upload. (File limit is 300 MB. If your file size is big break it up into smaller files).\nClick Upload file and import. A screen shows prompting you to assign the author.\n\nCreate an author. Enter your name, if unsure. \nCheck Download and import file attachments to retrieve the images and other media of your original site.\nClick Submit.\n\nThe importer will take a few minutes to run and give you an “All Done Have Fun” message.\n\nAdditional tasks after migration\nResave Permalinks\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nLogin to WP Admin.\nGo to Settings > Permalink. The Permalink Settings page shows.\nClick Save Changes.\nRun the Elementor Replace URL tool\nLogin to WP Admin.\nGo to Elementor > Tools > Replace URL.\nUnder Update Site Address (URL), enter the old url and new url.\n\nClick Replace URL.\nGo to General.\nClick Regenerate Files & Data.\n\nClick Save Changes.\nReplace any missing images / dependencies\n\nBackground images are stored in a CSS file with an absolute URL. To prevent migration issues related to these images, set the CSS Print Method to internal embedding rather than using external files. For details, see Site Migration Issues.\n\nLogin to WP Admin.\n\nGo to Elementor > Settings > Performance.\n\nSet CSS Print Method to Internal Embedding.\n\nHave more questions?

Depending on what changes are not appearing, try the below troubleshooting steps.\n\nIssue\tSolution\nFiles or Data Files issues\t1. Go to WP Admin > Elementor > Tools.\n2. Click Regenerate Files & Data.\nCache and optimization issues\t1. Clear optimizations and cache third-party plugins before updating. Ensure that they are disabled when you update.\n2.

Deactivate and clear optimizations and cache before updating. Ensure that they are disabled when you update.\n2. Ensure that you do not have server caching enabled. You may need to consult your current hosting provider for additional assistance.\nCache and Optimization issues\n\nCache or optimizations can prevent your changes from appearing online.\nDo one or more of the following to troubleshoot the issue:\n\nDisable any third-party WordPress optimization or cache plugins.\nTemporarily clear/disable any server-level caching. You may need to consult your hosting provider for help with this.\nClear your browser cache or test the page using incognito mode.\nIssues with Features or Experiments\n\nAn issue with a feature or experiment can prevent your changes from appearing online.\n\nDo one or more of the following to troubleshoot the issue:\n\nDeactivate Elementor features to eliminate issues with experimental features, mainly performance features such as Inline Font Icons and Improved CSS Loading. You can deactivate features by going to WP Admin > Elementor > Settings > Features. See this article for more information: Elementor features.\nDisable any third-party WordPress optimization or cache plugins.\nTemporarily clear/disable any server-level caching. If you need help with this, consult your hosting provider.\nClear your browser cache or test the page using incognito mode.\nIncorrect Server/WordPress configuration\n\nServer or WordPress configurations may affect how stylesheets are generated, preventing your changes from appearing online.\n\nDo one or more of the following to troubleshoot the issue:\n\nIf you recently added SSL or made other changes in your domain or file directory, ensure these changes are aligned. Go to Settings > General on the WordPress dashboard and check that both the WordPress Address (URL) and Site Address (URL) are the same and that both are either http:// or https://.\nPermalinks can affect your layout or stylesheet. Go to WP Admin>Settings>Permalinks and set permalinks to Plain. \nCheck your Custom Server Configuration/Optimization.\nCheck your .htaccess custom code/configuration.\nIssues with CSS Print method\n\nThe CSS print method can affect your stylesheet.\n\nTo troubleshoot the issue:\n\nIn the WP Admin, go to Elementor>Settings>Performance and check the CSS Print Method.\nIf it is set to External File, set it to Internal File. If it is set to Internal File, set to External File.\nTest to see if this resolves the issue.\nUnclosed HTML tags, CSS or custom codes\n\nIf you added custom code or CSS to Elementor widgets, Global Settings or Theme and did not close the HTML tags, this can prevent your changes from appearing online.\n\nTo troubleshoot the issue:\n\nCheck any custom code or CSS added on to global settings and verify that the code works, checking for any unclosed, or improperly closed, tags.\nIf you added any inline styling to widgets (such as the Heading, Text Editor or HTML widgets), check them for unclosed, or improperly closed tags.\nCheck your pages for custom CSS. An easy way to check is to open the Navigator and look for any highlighted elements. These highlights indicate that the element contains custom CSS, motion effects or absolute positioning.\nThe Element Caching experimental feature\n\nIf you activated the Element Caching experimental feature, this can lead to issues with changes appearing online.\n\nTo troubleshoot the issue:\n\nDeactivate the Element Caching experiment. For details, see Activate Elementor experimental features.\nthumbs_up_down\nTip\nWe recommend not switching back and forth between the Elementor Editor and native WordPress editor. This can lead to content issues. \nWhen you export an SVG image from an SVG editor, it should have a unique ID. It can lead to errors if it has a custom size but doesn’t have a unique ID. Fix this by re-exporting the image with a unique ID or set the width size in pixels (PX). \nThemes can sometimes prevent changes from appearing – for instance if the theme CSS overrides the Elementor CSS. To check, switch to a default WordPress theme or the Elementor Hello theme. If it is a theme issue, contact the developers for assistance.\n\n\nContact support\n\nIf you have tried the above steps and still haven’t resolved the issue. Contact support for further assistance. For more details, see how to submit a support ticket.\n\nHave more questions?

For details, see Receive form submissions by email.\n\nThe information in these email submissions is generated by shortcodes. By default, these emails are generated by the shortcode [all-fields] which will include all the data captured by the form. This, and the default formatting of the email, can make the contents difficult to read.\n\nIn this example, we’ll use individual field shortcodes and a small bit of HTML, to generate a much more human readable form submissions.  \n\nNote\nIf you own an Elementor hosted website and have a custom domain name, you may want to authenticate you emails.\nCreate Your Form\n\nFor this example, we’ll use the case of a website creator designing a site for a wedding photographer. The site will include a form that will ask potential clients for their:\n\nFirst name\nLast name\nEmail\nEvent date\nPhone\nLocation\nMessage\n\nAfter potential clients submit a form, an email is sent to photographer so they can contact the client.\n\nFor details about creating forms, see Form widget.\n\nThis is what the form looks like:\n\nGo to each form field and:\n\nOpen the field.\n\nClick the Advanced tab.\nIn the ID field, give the following names to these fields:\n\nFirst name: first_name\nLast name: last_name\nEmail: email\nEvent date: eventdate\nPhone: phone\nLocation: location\nMessage: message\n\nNote\nField IDs should be either one word or two words connected by an underscore. IDs should not contain any spaces.\n\n\nCopy the shortcode for each field in a separate document, the shortcode can also be found in the Advanced tab.\nCreate An HTML Email Template\n\nNext, we’ll use these shortcodes along with some basic HTML to generate a clear, comprehensible email that will be sent to the website owner when a potential client submits a form.\n\nIn the panel, open the Email field.\n\nThis section determines who receives an email when a form is submitted and what the email will look like.\nIn the To field, add the email of the photographer and change the Subject line to: Potential new customer.\nThe email\n\nBy default, the email will simply contain the information submitted with the form. For this example, will use simple HTML and shortcodes to create a friendlier notification. In the Message box, add the following:\n\n\n<h1>You have a new wedding to plan.</h1>\n\n<p>[field id=”first_name”] would like you to contact them about planning their wedding on [field id=”eventdate”] at [field id=”location”].</p>\n\n<p>The couples vision and plans so far are as follows:<br>\n\n[field id=”message”]</p>\n\n<h2>Contact Information</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>First Name: [field id=”first_name”]</li>\n\n<li>Last Name: [field id=”last_name”] </li>\n\n<li>Email Address: [field id=”email”] </li>\n\n<li>Phone Number: [field id=”phone”]</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Good luck at the event!</strong></p>\n\nNote\nIn the panel, make sure that the Send As field is set to send HTML emails.\n\n\nThe email sent by the form will look like this:\n\nFinishing Up\n\nYou may now publish or update your form. Send a test submission to yourself to see how the generated email appears. Use additional HTML and inline CSS to further style the email as needed.\n\nHave more questions?

We have now focused on achieving a faster page load by reducing the amount of unused CSS generated by the pages by adding the Conditional and Inline CSS Loading.\n\nConditional CSS Load\n\nUntil Core v3.3.0 , all the CSS was loaded in the same file: frontend.css (120KB in Elementro core, 225KB in Elementor Pro ). This means CSS assets that are not in use are being loaded anyway, a thing that harms page score and generates render-blocking processes.\n\nNow, we load only the CSS of the widgets that are placed in your page once. This way, we save up to 37KB of render-blocking assets (CSS) in Elementor Core, and save up to 171KB, based on your usage.\n\nInline CSS Load\n\nIn order to prevent multiple requests to the server, we are now loading the CSS files as inline style tags. This will reduce even further the render-blocking processes and should improve the overall performance (only up to 8KB, otherwise – the CSS file will be loaded as an inline link tag).\n\nIf the widget is being used more than once, there will not be an additional request or print.\n\nThe mechanism of understanding the CSS file size (the “expensive act”) will happen once for a widget.\n\nHave more questions?

This does not /about.\n\nBelow you will find instructions on how to use each of the plugins mentioned above as well as the following FAQs.\n\nHow do I publish a redirect to my static site?\nCan I use REGEX redirects on my static site?\nRedirection \nInstall and activate the Redirection Plugin.\nComplete the plugin setup by selecting the default options.\nNavigate to Tools > Redirection.\nAdd a new redirection rule using relative links with trailing slashes.\nPerform a Selective or Full publish (learn how).\nMake sure to test on your preview or live static site!\nAdditional Settings\nIt is recommended that you use the URL Monitor feature (navigate to Tools > Redirections > Options), which automatically creates a redirect to the new URL when a post or page slug is changed.\nThe built in 404 logging feature will log 404s on the WordPress site, and not on either the static live or preview site.  \nSafe Manager Redirect \nInstall and activate the Safe Redirect Manager Plugin.\nNavigate to Tools > Safe Manager Redirect.\nClick Create Redirect Rule.\nAdd a new redirection rule using relative links with trailing slashes.\nPerform a Selective or Full publish (learn how).\nMake sure to test on your preview or live static site!\nSimple 301 \nInstall and activate the Simple 301 Redirects plugin.\nNavigate to Settings > 301 Redirects.\nClick Create Redirect Rule.\nAdd a new redirection rule using relative links with trailing slashes.\nClick Add New.\nPerform a Selective or Full publish (learn how).\nMake sure to test on your preview or live static site!\nYoast SEO Premium\nInstall and activate the Yoast SEO Premium plugin (this feature is not available in the free version).\nNavigate to SEO > Redirects.\nHere you can easily enter the old URL and the new one you’d like to redirect it to.\nSelect the type of redirect.\nClick the Add Redirect button.\nPerform a Selective or Full publish (learn how).\nMake sure to test on your preview or live static site!\nRank Math\nInstall and activate the Rank Math plugin.\nThe redirections module must be enabled under Rank Math > Dashboard > Modules.\nThe redirections page can be found in Rank Math > Redirections.\nClick Add New.\nHere you can easily enter the old URL and the new one you’d like to redirect it to.\nSelect the type of redirect.\nSet the status as active.\nClick the Add Redirection.\nPerform a Selective or Full publish (learn how).\nMake sure to test on your preview or live static site!\nPublish your redirects to your static site\n\nIf you have made many redirects, your best option would be to run a Full Publish.\n\nIf you have only made one or two redirects you may prefer to use Selective Publish from the Publish Options page.\n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nFrom the WordPress dashboard, go to Static Site > Publish Options.\nInput the URL that you are redirecting from.\nClick Selective publish. For example: if /this-page/ redirects to /that-page/\nInput /this-page/ and then click the selective publish to live/preview button.\n\nIt is important to mention that if you have not yet published the new page that you are redirecting to (example: /that-page/), then you should also add that path to the selective publish as well. This will result in both the old page and the new page being published simultaneously.\n\nFAQs\nCan I use REGEX redirects on my static site?\n\nREGEX Redirects are redirects that use Regular Expressions to match multiple source URLs and send them all to the same destination. We’re working on a feature to make this possible.\n\nWhat if my URL has a capital letter in it?\n\nIt is recommended that you use lowercase letters in your URL/slug.\n\nWhenever a capital is used and the slug is not capitalized, the lowercase version of the URL will be displayed.\n\nExample: /This-Slug/ would be redirected to /this-slug/\n\nHave more questions? We’re more than happy to assist.\n\nContact Support\nNEXT\nConnect your domain to your Elementor Static website\nNext\nOn this page\nRedirection \nAdditional Settings\nSafe Manager Redirect \nSimple 301 \nYoast SEO Premium\nRank Math\nPublish your redirects to your static site\nFAQs\nCan I use REGEX redirects on my static site?\nWhat if my URL has a capital letter in it?\nIs this article helpful?\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated Content\n\nUse Adminer to access your site database\n\nUse SFTP to transfer files to your Elementor Static Website\n\nConnect your domain to your Elementor Static website\n\nWeb creation\n\nWebsite Builder & Hosting\nStatic Hosting + Builder\nPage Builder Plugin\nHello Theme\nDynamic Content\nEcommerce\nTheme Builder\nLanding Page Builder\nPopup Builder\nForm Builder\nWorkflow Optimization\nElementor AI\nImage Optimizer\nWooCommerce Builder\n\nPricing\n\nWordPress Hosting\nStatic Hosting\nPage Builder Plugin\n\n\nElementor For\n\n\nWeb Designers\nDevelopers\nMarketers\nAgencies\n\nResources\n\nHelp Center\nAcademy\nBlog\nAdd-Ons\nRoadmap\nDevelopers Website\nSupport\nWeb Creators Glossary\nIntegrations\nWeb Creator Stories\nMeetups\nAI’s Prompt Library\nWordPress Download\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nCareers\nFAQs\nAffiliate Program\nTrust Center\nMedia\nTrademark\nTerms & Conditions\nAI Terms & Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nWebsite Accessibility Statement\nOpen-Source Software Components\n\nElementor is the leading website builder platform for professionals on WordPress.

That would work great on Static Hosting!\nNo– If you need the checkout/cart functionality, then the answer is no, we don’t support that yet. WooCommerce depends heavily on interactions with the database for its shopping cart, and therefore it won’t work out of the box on a static website.\nAre WooCommerce Add-ons supported?\n\nSince there are over 6,000 WordPress plugins related to WooCommerce, we’d recommend trying them out in your static preview environment first. In general, if they don’t need AJAX, they shouldn’t be a problem.\n\nStatic friendly alternatives to WooCommerce\n\nThere are several static friendly ecommerce services, such as.

Elementor does not offer support for these programs. \n\nFAQ\nAre these file transfers secure?\n\nSecure FTP is one of the safest ways of transferring files. It uses encryption, separate communication channels and hashing to protect your data.\n\nHow come I can’t login to the server?\n\nSFTP relies heavily on user credentials for authentication. If your username or password is incorrect, you won’t be able to login to the server.\n\nWhen should I use SFTP?\n\nSFTP is generally used when transferring large files, multiple files or files not suitable for the media library. It can also be used to transfer your website’s files between folders.\n\nHow many files can I transfer?\n\nThere is no limit to the amount of files for your website but you do have limited space depending upon what plan you purchased. Check your plans terms and conditions for the amount of space available for your site. \n\nHow do I add a robots.txt, ads.txt or other verification files to my site?\n\nThird parties, such as Google, may require you to upload certain files to your site. Upload these files using the SFTP procedure described in this article. Consult the third party’s instructions for directions on where to place the file within your site’s directory. \n\nHave more questions?

Under general settings, there are options for controlling what user roles in WordPress have the ability to publish the static site.\n\nYou can control who publishes to the Live site and Preview site independently. Depending on your team you may want to grant only administrators the ability to publish the live static site.\nForms Settings\n\nGo to Publish Site, and click the Forms tab.\n\nAll static sites come with a custom forms API that enables certain WordPress contact form plugins to work on the static site. Currently, we support Elementor Forms, Contact Form 7 and Gravity Forms.\n\nThe Forms tab has settings for:\n\nAdding your own SMTP server settings,\nAdding Google reCaptcha spam protection\nConnecting non-ajax forms to third party solutions\nAdvanced Settings\n\nGo to Publish Site, and click the Advanced tab. The advanced settings tab has several options for how your site is optimized during the publishing process.\n\nPublishing Actions\nStop Publish\n\nWhen publishing, you can cancel a publish by clicking Stop Publish. Any content that has already been published by the current process will remain published.\n\nPublishing Optimization\n\nPublishing Optimization allows to disable the creation of static pages for your attachments, various feeds, archives and embedded pages. Much of the time you can disable these and it will speed up the publishing time for your site.\n\nShortlinks\n\nShortlinks can be disabled in advanced settings. Shortlinks: refers to WordPress’s built-in feature that lets you shorten links. By default, these shortlinks wouldn’t work on Strattic because they use query parameters.\n\nYou could use a plugin like http://wordpress.org/plugins/shorten-url/ to shorten the URLs on your site. There are many URL shortener plugins in the WordPress repository. As long as the plugins are using the WordPress hook wp_get_shortlink( $post_id ) then they should work great.\n\nBy default, Shortlinks is disabled in the  settings in order to reduce your publish time, but if you would like to use a URL shortener plugin, you’ll need to enable the Shortlinks setting under Advanced Settings in order for the Short URLs to be included in the URLs that get sent for publishing.\n\nAdditional non-essential URLs\n\nBy disabling/unticking this setting, commonly unused static assets will not be published, this helps to reduce the publishing time.\n\nExamples of what would be excluded:\n\nInactive theme files\nInactive plugins\nWordPress admin assets  \n\nThe final setting lets you add non-standard pages to your static site. This feature is not generally needed.\n\nSearch Settings\n\nGo to Publish Site > Search Templates and click on the Settings tab. WordPress search will automatically be replaced on a site with the static supported Algolia search.\n\nSearch Index: If you do not require search on your site, you can disable this.\nTaxonomy Search: adds the ability to search within a category, tag, and taxonomy titles and descriptions.\nSearch Results Slug: By default, your search results page slug is  yoursite.com/search. You can change this to a different URL if desired. You do not need to have a page in WordPress to match this URL.\nExcerpt Length override: This lets you control the excerpt length for search results.\n\nYou can also customize how search results are displayed.

Your WordPress website is housed in our unique secure, containerized environment, which you wake up when needed through your Elementor Account (it shuts down for extra security and environmental reasons). You would use this development environment to make edits to your website, such as adding new content, installing plugins, or updating your theme.\n\n When creating internal links you should use the staging url of your site (https://example.site.strattic.io/about-us/) or relative links like /about-us/. This url will get rewritten to your live or preview url when you do a Static publish.\n\n  \n\nPreview\nhttps://example.preview.elementorstatic.com/\n\nThe Preview environment is ideal for reviewing your website and testing any major changes or updates you have implemented. By publishing to the Preview site, you’ll be able to see how an updated static version of your site will look before updating your live static site.\n\nYour Preview site is blocked from search engines with the X-robots-tag HTTP header.\n\n \n\nLive\nhttps://example.live.elementorstatic.com/ or https://www.yourdomain.com\nBefore connecting your domain\n\nPublishing to Live will generate a static version of your WordPress site. The Live static version will become your public-facing site once you connect your domain. In the meantime, you can test publishing to the live version until you’re ready to launch.\n\n Your live site is blocked from search engines with the X-robots-tag HTTP header until your custom domain is connected. \n\nAfter connecting your domain\n\nOnce you connect your custom domain to your static site, our system rewrites all the URLs to the updated domain name. Your domain name will now be public-facing for your visitors to see.\n\n The live URL (example.live.strattic.io) will no longer be available (since it has been replaced by your real custom domain).\n\n Live static sites cannot be edited directly. You’ll need to make any updates or edits in the staging/WordPress environment first and then re-publish using the Static Publish button.\n\n  \n\nWhich environment does SFTP connect to?\n\nWhen using SFTP to access your Static hosted website files, you will be connecting to the Staging environment. Any edits you make directly on the server will not show on either the Preview or Live environments until you perform a Static publish from within the WordPress dashboard.\n\n \n\nSearch Indexing\n\nAll publish types (full, quick and selective) will trigger the static search index to update.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHave more questions?

After the static site is launched, it does not have a connection to the WordPress database.\n\nThis can affect native WordPress functionality, like search and comments. Certain types of WordPress Plugins may also not function as expected with a static site.\n\nWordPress themes generally have no problems, unless they come with special functionality like forms.\n\nIn this article, we go over the things we do at Elementor to make many of these features work as well as static-friendly tools you can use to replace WordPress plugins not compatible with static sites.\n\nNative WordPress functionality\nSite Search\n\nWe automatically replace the WordPress search with a custom Algolia solution. Advanced Search with filters that rely on query parameters is not supported yet.\n\nComments\n\nCurrently, native WordPress comments are not supported.\n\nHowever, Disqus, FB comments and other third-party comments are supported.\n\nPassword Protected Pages\n\nThis feature is supported on Elementor Static sites.\n\nScheduled Posts\n\nThis feature is supported.\n\nFeeds\n\nThis feature is supported on Static sites.\n\nMultisite\n\nNot supported yet.\n\nDynamic Functionality\nForms\n\nWe support Elementor Forms, Contact Form 7, and Gravity Forms out of the box.\n\neCommerce\n\nWe don’t yet support WooCommerce functionality. There are lots of alternative solutions that would work on a static site such as Ecwid and Snipcart.\n\nMemberships\n\nWe don’t yet support membership login functionality.\n\nForums\n\nWe support several third-party forum solutions such as Discourse.  We do not yet support WordPress forum plugins such as BuddyPress or bbPress.\n\nAjax Get requests \n\nStatic sites do not support Ajax Get requests.\n\nQuery parameters\n\nStatic sites do not support query parameters that would change the content on the page. However, query parameters like UTM, GCLID, etc are supported.\n\nInfinite Scrolling\n\nYou can add infinite scrolling using these plugins: DMD Infinite Scroll, WP EasyScroll Posts and YITH Infinite Scrolling.\n\nCaching plugins\n\nCaching plugins are not needed on Static sites. The best practice is to disable any caching functionality. It is recommended to maintain any minification functionality.\n\nSecurity plugins\n\nSecurity plugins are not needed on Static sites. The best practice is to disable them so that they are not using server resources and putting any unneeded load on your site.\n\nImage Optimization Plugins\n\nYes! Images should be optimized to the smallest possible size using a tool like https://tinypng.com or WordPress plugins such as Imagify or Cloudinary. This can have a very significant impact on load time.\n\nMinification (HTML, CSS, JS)\n\nYes! HTML, CSS, and JS should be minified to improve site performance. This can be done using plugins such as Autoptimize or WP-Rocket.\n\nAMP\n\nYes! We built out support so that you can AMP-lify posts and pages with AMP for WP!\n\nSEO Plugins\n\nSEO plugins like Yoast SEO and RankMath are supported, including support for sitemaps.\n\nRedirection Plugins\n\nWe support the Redirection, Safe Redirect Manager, Simple 301 Redirects and Yoast Premium plugins.\n\nMultilingual Plugins\n\nWe support Polylang and WPML. GTranslate is not supported.\n\nRelative dates\n\nMake sure that your theme uses absolute dates (April 3, 1999) instead of relative dates (1 day ago).\n\nCustom fields\n\nCustom field plugins like ACF( Advanced Custom Fields) are supported.\n\nCoschedule\n\nWe built out support for Coschedule, a popular way to manage social media postings!\n\nComeet\n\nWe built out support for Comeet, a popular Applicant Tracking Platform!\n\nThemes and Page Builders\nThemes/Frameworks/Page Builders\n\nYes!

You can replace the temporary domain that was automatically assigned when you first created your site simply by adding a custom domain at any time. See full instructions for adding your own domain name here.\n\nThose instructions mention DNS Propagation. What is DNS Propagation?\n\nDNS Propagation is the amount of time it takes for DNS changes to be updated around the world, across the internet. DNS stands for Domain Name System. DNS is like an address book for the Internet. It is like a directory of names (domain names) matched up with their addresses (IP addresses), which lets users navigate websites via human-readable names rather than having to remember an IP address for every website. The directory is shared and stored among DNS servers around the world to split up the load. These DNS servers periodically check for updates and these updates take time to propagate across the world. Once you’ve added your custom domain, you’ll need to wait a short period of time for all the world’s DNS servers to know about the change.\n\nHow long does it take for DNS to propagate and why does it sometimes take so long?\n\nA change to a DNS record can take up to 72 hours to propagate worldwide although it typically takes only a few hours.\n\nDNS servers across the world periodically check for any changes to the DNS records. If you change your DNS records, it takes time for those changes to be checked and noted by each DNS server around the globe. \n\nIn addition, every DNS record has a Time to Live (TTL) value, which is the amount of time that DNS servers should store that record in their cache. So even when you change a record, DNS servers will continue working with its formal value from cache until this time has passed. If your registrar allows this, you can set your record’s TTL value to a low number, which will help speed up the process.\n\nRegardless of the TTL value, each server has its own schedule and some take longer than others to update their records. Until they update, they will continue to use the old records that they have cached. This means that if you’ve pointed a domain name to a new IP address, for example, then for a period of time, some places will be seeing your old site (using your old DNS records), and some places will be seeing your new site.\n\nHow can I check to see if my site has propagated around the world?\n\nThere are several free online tools that make it easy to see if your site is propagating around the world. DNS Checker is one such tool Enter your domain name (e.g. example.com) into the DNS Checker and click Search. Servers across the world will check to see which IP address is serving your domain at that moment. If a server lists your new IP address (from your Elementor hosted website), then you know that your DNS changes have propagated to that server and users in that area will likely be seeing your new site. This is a quick spot check to see how quickly propagation takes place across the world, but of course, it is only representative of a few DNS servers.\n\nShould I use example.com or www.example.com? \n\nThere isn’t one right answer for this question. The best answer is to choose one as your canonical address, and redirect the other to it, so you avoid confusing search engines that may think they are two separate sites with different content. If you plan to use a CDN, you may need to use the www version as it is often required. Some CDNs, such as Cloudflare, now have workarounds that allow you to use a non-www URL, but not all do. In general, a example.com is easier and less cumbersome to share with users, but the www version does have some advantages, such as the ability to use CNAME records which propagates DNS changes more quickly than A records, and the ability to set cookies specifically for that subdomain. If none of this makes any sense to you, and you don’t plan to use a CDN, then just go with whichever you prefer. There is no difference in terms of SEO, as long as one redirects to the other. Choose one and stick with it. If you’d like to read a more in-depth discussion about this, click here.\n\nHave more questions?

Now it’s time to attach a great name to your beautiful site.\n\nWhen you purchase an Elementor hosted website, your site is assigned a name (e.g. mycoolsite.elementor.cloud). However, you’ll probably want to give it a more memorable name like mycoolsite.com \n\nIf you don’t currently own a name, check out our guide to buying a domain name. \n\nOnce you’ve purchased a name, or if you already have a custom name, you’re ready to add it to your Elementor website. This means that when visitors type mycoolsite.com in the address bar of their browser, they’ll go to your site. \n\nIn order to do this, you will first need to make some changes to the DNS records of your domain name. This document will walk you through the steps.\n\nHow does it work\n\nThese are the steps you need to follow when adding a custom domain:\n\nStep 1: Get your website details from my.elementor.\n\nStep 2: Configure your DNS records at your domain registrar’s website.\n\nStep 3: Enter the domain name and choose if you want to set it as primary. You will be given an option to create a www variant as well. Then, you will finish the process on my.elementor and verify that your domain is fully operational.\n\nConnect a custom domain to your Elementor Hosting website\nFrom My Elementor dashboard , go to Websites and click the Manage This Website button located in your website’s card to open the site details screen. From the Manage Domains section, click Connect my domain.\n\nIn the popup window, enter the custom domain name you purchased and click Let’s begin. Generally, you will use the domain name without www in front of it.\n\nBy default, the system will use the name you entered as the primary domain and will also connect the name with www in front of it. (e.g. mysite.com will be the primary domain and www.mysite.com will also be connected.)\nIf these defaults are okay, click Let’s begin.\n\nFor this next step you’ll need to open a new tab in your browser and sign into your domain name provider account if you haven’t already.You’re now starting the process of pointing your domain to your Elementor site.\n\nOnce signed in, click I signed in, what’s next?\n\n\nOnce you’ve logged in to your registrar’s website in a new browser tab, you’ll need to access the settings for your domain.This will vary according to your domain name provider.Once you’ve found your domain settings click Found it, what’s next?\n\n\nWithin your domain registrar Domain settings page, locate the A and CNAME records, go back to the Elementor tab and click Found them, what’s next?\n\nYou can now access the A record and CNAME of your Elementor hosted website.\nUse the icon to copy the A record and CNAME.\n\nGo to your domain registrar, paste these values, and update the A record and CNAME found in your domain settings.\nExample of adding an A Record: \n\nExample of adding a CNAME Record:\nwarningImportant: If your domain is marked as Parked or is a AAAA domain, you may have to remove the existing record.\nwarningImportant: If your domain is hosted at Cloudflare, you cannot turn on Proxy as this will not allow the domain to be properly connected. It has to be set to ‘DNS Only’ Domains.\nGo back to the Elementor tab and click I updated my records. Connect my domain\n\n\nWait for the process to complete.\nIn this process, Elementor will:\n• Add the domain to your site.\n• Verify your DNS records.\n• Issue an SSL certificate for the domain.\n\ninfoThe Process can take up to 48 hours. Once the process is complete, you will be notified by email.\nWarning\nCAA records specify which certificate authorities have permission to certify your domain. You do not have to specify a CAA but if you have added any CAA records, you must have Cloudflare listed as a CAA. To learn how to add Cloudflare as a CAA, see Add CAA records (external link).\n\nFor more information on DNS propagation, why it takes time, and how to check its status\n\nHave more questions?

Plugins can contain hundreds of files, and accessing all these files tax server resources. \n\nAccelerated plugins available through Elementor Hosting, speed up file access by storing plugin files in the server’s RAM as opposed to reading them from a disk. This means your site loads faster when you edit it, and responds more quickly when website visitors access it.  \n\nFind and install accelerated plugins\n\nFor a full list of accelerated plugins, see List of accelerated plugins.\n\nTo use accelerated plugins:\n\nSearch the WordPress repository for a plugin. For more details, see Find and Install WordPress plugins.  \n\nNote the   icon. This indicated the plugin is part of Elementor Hosting accelerated plugin program. \n\nInstall the plugin.  For more details, see Find and Install WordPress plugins\n\nAccelerated plugins are listed under the plugins tab of your WordPress dashboard. They are marked with a special icon  for accelerated plugins.\n\nEnable acceleration on an existing plugin\n\nIf you are already using a plugin that can be accelerated, acceleration will automatically be added the next time you update the plugin. You can also manually enable the acceleration feature.\n\nTo enable acceleration:\n\nFrom your WordPress dashboard, locate the plugin.\nClick Accelerate Plugin.\nDisable plugin acceleration\n\nIf you need to disable plugin acceleration:\n\nFrom your WordPress dashboard, locate the plugin. \nClick the accelerated plugin icon .\nConfirm that you want to disable the acceleration.\n\nNote: Your plugin will remain installed, just the acceleration will be disabled.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhen using the accelerated plugin feature and logging into my SFTP – my plugin files are inaccessible – why is that?\n\nAccelerated plugins use symlinks. This means the plugins are not on your site, but are shared among many sites. This makes them much faster but read-only. \n\nIf I switch from Elementor hosting – will accelerated plugins still work?\n\nNo, this is an exclusive feature of Elementor hosting.\n\nDoes this mean I can’t upload any custom plugin files? \n\nYou can still upload custom plugin files just as before.

From secure GCP built-in hosting to website storage, bandwidth and custom domains, Elementor has you covered. \n\nOf course, when it comes to details such as storage and bandwidth limits, there can be confusion about what it all means at a practical level. So let’s take a closer look at what these things mean. \n\nThis article will explain how website bandwidth and storage needs change with different types of websites and how website owners can effectively make use of Elementor website storage and bandwidth limits to store and host website data. \n\nDetermining website storage and bandwidth needs \n\nBefore we discuss how much website bandwidth and storage your website actually requires we have to understand what website bandwidth and storage are : \n\nIn simple terms, website storage is the hard drive storage for your website. The only way it is different from your laptop/PC storage is that it is not installed in your computer but available as storage on hosting provider servers (in Elementor’s case this is cloud storage). \n\nWebsite bandwidth, on the other hand, refers to the total amount of data that can be sent back and forth from the website to the user. More available bandwidth means either more users can access your website simultaneously or the users visiting your site at any point  can access more data from your website.\n\nWebsite bandwidth and storage are linked with each other as illustrated in this example: \n\nSuppose you own a blogging website that contains 100 blogs with a fair amount of images and videos. Per blog size is 5MB including all the images and content. Then the total minimum website storage that you require comes out to be 100*5MB = 500 MB.\n\nWhen it comes to determining the website bandwidth for the 500 MB blogging website it is dependent on the number of visitors reading the blog. For example, if one 5MB blog is read by 100 people at the same time, 500 MB of bandwidth is required. \n\nWebsite storage and bandwidth limits on Elementor Cloud \n\nNow that we have a perspective on how website bandwidth and storage work together, let’s see how much an Elementor hosted website subscription provides in terms of storage and bandwidth limits.\n\nA single Elementor website subscription provides 100 GB of website bandwidth and 20 GB of website storage.\n\nPage Type\tVisitors\tMin. bandwidth equivalent\n5 MB (Typical Long Form Blog Page)\t10,000-20,000\t50-100 GB\n10MB (WordPress Theme Based Online Portfolio Page)\t1,000-10,000\t10-100 GB\n2 MB (Ecommerce Page Listing)\t10,000-50,000\t20-100 GB\nPage Size\tNumber of\nweb pages stored\tWeb storage equivalent\n5 MB (Typical Long Form Blog Page)\t1,000-4,000\t5-20 GB\n10MB (WordPress Theme Based Online Portfolio Page)\t1,000-2,000\t10-20 GB\n2 MB (Ecommerce Page Listing)\t5,000-10,000\t10-20 GB\n\nAs you can see from the above figures, the storage space available to Elementor hosted website owners provides more than enough room even for large websites to accommodate strong traffic.    \n\nFinal words\n\nThere are many other factors other than website storage and bandwidth that must be considered before opting for a website hosting subscription. See this page for a full overview of Elementor hosted website features.\n\nIf you still have questions or a website with special requirements, contact us here. We’ll be happy to help.\n\nHave more questions?

This is being used for their live website  – mysite.com. Alex, however, wants to use a development site to completely redesign the site. To do this, they create a subdomain dev.mysite.com and redesign the site there. Using Elementor Pro on this domain will NOT count as a license activation and they can continue using their one activation for the live site.\nWhat domains can be used?\n\nFollowing is a list of staging/development sites that won’t count towards your license activations – just replace “example” with your site name. Keep in mind that the domain name must match one of the following formats in order for it not to count as an activation.\n\nTLD (Top-level Domains) that are not considered as an activation:\n\n.dev (example.dev)\n.local (example.local)\n.test (example.test)\n.staging (example.staging)\n.example (example.example)\n.invalid (example.invalid)\n.lh (example.lh)\n\nSubdomains that are not considered an activation:\n\ndev.* (dev.example.com). This can also be implemented as:\nexampledev.* (exampledev.example.com)\nlocal.* (local.example.com)\ntest.* (test.example.com). This can also be implemented as:\n*.test.* (example.test.example.com)\nstaging.* (staging.example.com). This can also be implemented as:\n*.staging.* (example.staging.example.com)\nstaging[0-9].* (staging6.example.com). This can also be implemented as:\n*.staging[0-9].*(example.staging6.example.com)\nstage.* (stage.example.com). This can also be implemented as:\n*.stage.* (example.stage.example.com)\n\nThere are also specific hosting companies or other web services with domains that do not count toward license activation. \n\n*.staging.wpengine.com (example.staging.wpengine.com)\n*stg.wpengine.com (examplestg.wpengine.com)\n*dev.wpengine.com (exampledev.wpengine.com)\ndev-*.pantheonsite.io (dev-example.patheonsite.io)\ntest-*.pantheonsite.io (test-example.pantheonsite.io)\nstaging-*.kinsta.com (staging-example.kinsta.com)\nstaging-*.kinsta.cloud (staging-example.kinsta.cloud)\n*.myftpupload.com (example.myftpupload.com)\n*.cloudwaysapps.com (example.cloudwaysapps.com)\n*.ngrok.io (example.ngrok.io)\n*-dev.ksysweb.com (example-dev.ksysweb.com)\n*-stg.ksysweb.com  (example-stg.ksysweb.com)\n*.mystagingwebsite.com (example.mystagingwebsite.com)\nstg-.*\\.kinsta\\.cloud/ (stg-example.kinsta.cloud)\nstaging-.*\\.kinsta\\.cloud/ (staging-example.kinsta.cloud)\nstaging-.*-staging\\.kinsta\\.cloud/ (staging-example-staging.kinsta.cloud)\nstaging-.*\\.kinsta\\.com/ (staging-example.kinsta.com)\n/ec2-\\d{1,3}-\\d{1,3}-\\d{1,3}-\\d{1,3}(\\.[a-z0-9-]+)*\\.compute(-1)?\\.amazonaws\\.com (/ec2-18-246-17-224.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/wordpress)\nenv-(.*)premium\\.kinsta\\.cloud/ (env-example-premium.kinsta.cloud)\nenv-(.*)premium[0-9]\\.kinsta\\.cloud/ (env-example-exapremium.kinsta.cloud)\ninfo\nNote\nThe Elementor license doesn’t allow subfolders to be used as staging sites that are not counted as activations.\nthumbs_up_down\nTip\nOwners of Business, Grow, and Scale Elementor hosted subscriptions, have staging sites as part of the their subscriptions. Staging sites are not available to owners of other Elementor hosted website subscriptions.\n\nIf the domain name you’re using for staging/development does not meet the above requirements, you will need to purchase an additional license (or upgrade to a higher tier plan) in order to activate Elementor Pro on it.\n\nYou can also remove the license from your main site, activate it on your staging/development site, and then return it back to the main site once you’re done with the changes.\n\nFor me details see, Can I Transfer the Elementor Pro License Key From One Domain to Another? | Elementor\n\nIf you still need help, please contact our Support Center.\n\nTo get the most out of Elementor, check out the Elementor Academy for helpful learning resources.\n\nHave more questions?

(Get Started)\nLast Update: September 21, 2023\nIntroduction\n\nA web host is a company that stores, manages, and serves files to internet users. Anyone with a website must have web hosting. But not all web hosts are alike.  While some provide a wide range of services, others simply play host to your website and serve it up to users on command.\n\nWhat Is Web Hosting?\n\nEvery time you type a URL into a browser, you’re issuing a command: “send me the files I need to view this website.” Your command goes to a server where the files are stored. That server is usually owned by a web hosting service—a company that specializes in storing, managing, securing, and sharing files.\n\nWhen you purchase web hosting, you’re renting space on a server or, in some cases, on a network of physical and virtual servers (AKA “the cloud”).  \n\nDepending on the web host you choose, you may be able to rent your own server (a pricey option), share a server with other websites (best for smaller sites), or become part of a large group of sites that are served by a network of computers and exist in the cloud, thereby lowering costs while still ensuring your site has all the resources it needs. \n\nKey Web Hosting Services\n\nWeb hosts come in all sizes, and provide a range of services – so you’ll want to research your options and choose carefully. The most important details you want to consider in your search for a web host are bandwidth and storage space, visitor limitations, and the content delivery network (CDN).  \n\nBandwidth is the amount of data that can be quickly moved to and from your website. You’ll need higher bandwidth if you’re providing a storefront, streaming video, or other interactive services. You need much less if you’re simply providing a static set of pages.\nStorage is the amount of data that can be stored on the server. Smaller sites need less storage space, but sites that are collecting customer data, making sales, or providing interactive experiences may need much more.\nMany hosts can limit the number of unique monthly visitors who can visit your site. If you’re expecting a large number of new users each month, be sure your host can accommodate them all. \nA CDN is a group of geographically dispersed servers. Spreading out servers reduces delays caused by the physical distance between a visitor’s computer and the website’s server. Always ensure your web host provides an adequate CDN to keep your site running at top speed. \n\nFor a more concrete look at bandwidth and storage limits, check out Understanding Elementor hosted website bandwidth and storage limits.\n\nManaged or Unmanaged Hosting?\n\nBefore you select a type of hosting, you’ll want to decide whether you want a managed or unmanaged option. \n\nChoose managed hosting and the hosting provider will configure and maintain the basic server details for you.\nSelect unmanaged hosting and you’ll be responsible for configuring and maintaining your server.\n\nUnmanaged hosting is the cheaper option. The reality, however, is that website management requires high level technical skills and quite a bit of dedicated time. Most users will want a managed solution. However, developers might prefer unmanaged hosting for added flexibility and/or cost savings.\n\nFour Top Hosting Options\n\nThere are four main types of web hosting available.\n\nShared hosting\nCloud hosting\nColocation\nVirtual Private Server\n\nEach offers slightly different services at different price points. \n\nOption 1 — Shared Hosting: Low Cost, Limited Services\n\nAs the name suggests, shared hosting means sharing resources with other accounts and websites on the hosting server. Because you’re sharing resources, you’ll save money. \n\nBut while some shared hosts advertise “unlimited websites”, “unlimited storage”, and/or “unlimited bandwidth,” the reality is that you may well run into limits if resources are overused. Some hosts offer “unmetered” versus “unlimited” storage, which means you aren’t charged by the amount of data you store, but you still have limits on the amount of storage available. Others have “fair use” policies: if you seem to be using more than your “fair share” of storage space or bandwidth, the host has the right to limit your processor time, bandwidth, processes, or memory.  If you have a larger site that requires more storage and bandwidth, shared hosting may not be your best option. \n\nOption 2 — Cloud Hosting: Reliable Service on a Flexible Platform\n\nCloud hosts own many servers in many locations—and all those servers work together to offer reliable, flexible hosting services.  \n\nYes, you are sharing the cloud with many other websites. But you don’t need to worry about storage or bandwidth limitations because there is so much available. Bottom line, on the cloud you always have the promised bandwidth and storage at your disposal.\n\nNeed more or less storage or bandwidth than you anticipated?  Cloud hosting makes it easy to scale up or down. It’s also a popular, cost-effective solution. That’s why Microsoft and Amazon are in the cloud hosting business: it’s growing fast because it works!\n\nOption 3 – Colocation Facility: An Option for Large Businesses  \n\nIf you own your own hosting hardware, including the servers, you might want to house your hardware in a colocation facility. Colocation facilities host a company’s servers, providing an Internet connection, a power supply and a climate-controlled environment. \n\nNot surprisingly, colocation facilities are used primarily by large businesses that find it cost-effective to own and manage their own websites.\n\nOption 4 – VPS Hosting: Virtual Private Servers \n\nVPS Hosting provides your website with its own individual private virtual service. Similarly to shared hosting, you share a physical server with other sites, but unlike shared hosting, your site has its own dedicated resources within the server so you’re not sharing resources with others.\n\nManaged hosting providers, cloud hosting providers and colocation facilities all offer virtual  private servers. While VPS was once a popular step up from shared hosting, most people will be better off with the cloud hosting approach because it offers more flexibility.\n\nElementor: Managed Cloud Hosting for WordPress Users\n\nIf you’ve built your website on WordPress, you need a host. You can select any host, but many WordPress users find it easier to work with a service that’s specifically built to optimize the WordPress Content Management System (CMS).  Elementor provides a managed, WordPress hosting. \n\nThe key thing that differentiates hosts like Elementor from “regular” hosting is a suite of concierge services that are added specifically for WordPress sites. These added services can save you time when it comes to maintaining your site.\n\nTypically, WordPress-specific hosts offer:\n\nAutomatic daily backups, with the option to manually back up your site if needed.\nAutomatic WordPress updates.\nWordPress-specific security rules.\nExpert WordPress support.\n\nAn Elementor hosted website takes the headache out of choosing hosting infrastructure by giving you a complete platform to build a website using WordPress and Elementor. Instead of spending valuable time on technical details, you simply sign up and start building your site using the pre-installed tools.\n\nElementor hosted websites also offer more transparent pricing by removing some of the hidden hosting costs that you’ll experience with other types of hosting.\n\nFor a flat annual fee, you’ll get an all-in-one WordPress website building  solution that includes the following:\n\nBuilt-in hosting from Google Cloud Platform\nSecure CDN by Cloudflare\nFree SSL certificate from Cloudflare\n20 GB storage\n100 GB bandwidth\n100K monthly visits\nFree custom domain connection\nFree sub domain elementor.cloud\nAutomatic daily backups\nManual backups from My Elementor account\n\nYou’ll also get access to Elementor Pro features at no extra cost, which lets you hit the ground running from day one.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFor most businesses, managed cloud-based hosting is a flexible, moderately priced solution. If you use WordPress to create your site, you’ll be best off with a managed cloud-based host that specializes in WordPress sites like yours. And if you’re seeking a flexible, professional, turnkey solution to build, manage, and host your WordPress site, Elementor is one of the best options available. \n\nHave more questions?

(Intro)\nLast Update: September 21, 2023\n\nWordPress was originally created as a way for bloggers to create websites without having to know any code. WordPress was, therefore, originally designed for creating posts. Over time, web creators began using WordPress to create full-fledged websites, and pages became more important. \n\nIn this article, you’ll learn the differences between posts and pages. You’ll also learn when it’s best to use posts and when you’d be better off using pages.\n\nWhat are posts?\n\nPosts are used when you want to share information that changes frequently or when you want to share content on social media. If you have a blog that you update on a daily basis, each daily blog entry is a post.\n\nOrganization\n\nPosts will appear in reverse chronological order. That means your newest posts will appear at the top of the page, and your older posts will be located at the bottom.\n\nFeatures\n\nPosts come with numerous built-in features that allow you to make them interactive:\n\nComment section \nButtons to share the posts on social media \n\nPosts also have built-in features that allow you to organize them more effectively:\n\nAuthor credit (you can include an author picture or avatar and a short biography)\nPublication date\nCategories\nTags\nWhen to use\n\nYou don’t have to limit your posts to blog entries. Posts are also great when you want to announce new product releases or exciting information about your company, when you have time sensitive content, or when you have a schedule of events, etc.\n\nWhat are pages?\n\nPages are a great way to describe your business or organization as a whole. The most common pages are the Home, About Us, Contact, and Product or Services pages. You can also use the 404 page to let your visitors know they’ve tried to reach a non-existent page on your site.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe organization of pages is hierarchical with parent pages and child pages. Parent pages have characteristics that they pass down to the child pages, like the overall theme or just the location of it. \n\nFeatures\n\nPages come with no built-in features. If you want a specific feature on one of your pages, you can achieve that functionality by installing plugins. \n\nWhen to use\n\nIt’s best to use pages for static content that rarely, or never, changes.\n\nPosts and pages, a side by side comparison\nWhat are Posts?\tWhat are Pages?\n\nTime: Dependent\t\nTime: Independent\n\nOrganization: Reverse chronological\t\nOrganization: Hierarchical\n\nBuilt-in features: Numerous\t\nBuilt-in features:  None\nPosts and pages – a comparison\n\nNote: You may, at certain points, come across the term “Post Types”. This is a category definition in WordPress and is unrelated to the term “post” as we use it in this article. \n\nConclusion\n\nIn this article we’ve covered the key differences between posts and pages. You now know when it’s best to use them and are well on your way to building a stunning website! Next, you may want to take a masterclass on how to create blog posts or learn how to create a blog with Elementor. To get the most out of Elementor, check out the Elementor Academy for more helpful learning resources.

Read on to learn about your hosting options!\nWhy WordPress?\n\nWelcome to the WordPress community! Since you’re just starting out, we know how crucial it is to choose the right platform to build a professional-looking and professionally functioning website. While WordPress is just one of many content management systems (CMS) it powers 43% of all websites worldwide. \n\nOne reason for WordPress’ dominance is the fact that it is open source – the code behind WordPress is available to anyone to use and edit. Not only does this make WordPress free to use, it also means that there is a whole world of third-party developers who’ve created plugins extending and expanding the power and functionality of WordPress. You can even write or commission your own plugins if you don’t find one that fits your needs. Basically, with WordPress you can create the site you want.\n\nAdditionally, by working in the open source world, you’re less likely to be locked into a specific technology supplier – a supplier that may decide to raise prices or institute other changes you have no control over.  \n\nWhat is hosting?\n\nWeb hosting is a service that stores your website data on servers and makes your site accessible online. To keep your website operating efficiently and securely, you’ll need a web host that provides the required resources and technology. \n\nIn most cases, when you sign up for a web hosting service, the host will install a CMS for you, and most will help you install WordPress. \n\nOf course, the easiest way to get started with WordPress is with an all-in-one package such as an Elementor hosted website, which offers WordPress hosting along with page and site building tools.  \n\nTop 3 plugins to add to your WordPress website\n\nPlugins are small pieces of software that you can add to your WordPress site for additional features and functionalities. You can find thousands of free plugins through the plugins tab on the WordPress dashboard, but here are three of the most important plugins you can add to your WordPress website.\n\n1. Elementor Website Builder\n\nThe Elementor plugin allows you to build and edit pages on your website –\n\nwith no coding required. With this plugin, you build your website with a visual editor that has drag-and-drop functionality and instant, live preview. Elementor is an open-source solution that includes numerous pre-installed widgets. Check out our Pro features for more perks and expanded features. \n\nWith the Elementor Website Builder, you can easily build your website and customize your pages! No coding is required!\n2. Yoast SEO\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) allows you to boost your website’s discoverability, relevance, and popularity. If you want to rank higher in search engine results, Yoast SEO can help you learn and automatically comply with SEO best practices.\n\nYoast SEO helps you to boost your website’s ranking on search engines!\n3. WooCommerce\n\nWooCommerce is the most widely used, free plugin to sell products online directly from your website. With WooCommerce, you can customize your storefront to fit your brand and business. If you use an Elementor Website Kit designed for an online store, it will automatically install the WooCommerce plugin for you. \n\nWooCommerce makes it easy to run an online shop by allowing you to add products, configure shipping options, and more! You can also view your total sales and orders per day, week, and month.\nChoosing your theme\n\nEvery WordPress website needs a theme. These themes change the appearance of your website’s design. Elementor hosted websites automatically install the Elementor Hello Theme onto your site. We highly recommend using the Hello Theme for those who’ve installed Elementor manually.  \n\nIf you choose to upgrade to Elementor Pro, you can efficiently create a custom theme using the Elementor Pro Theme Builder. With Elementor, you can also take advantage of website kits, which give you a complete, responsive website design right out of the box.\n\nCreating your site’s pages\n\nPages are the backbone of any website and contain all of your content. WordPress includes a ready-to-use page builder; but, you’ll probably be better off using a third-party editor such as Elementor. Elementor’s robust features allow you to efficiently create a professional-looking, high-quality website.\n\nThe menu\n\nYour website menu helps your visitors quickly navigate to the most important pages and sections of your website. Menus are typically located in the website header, but they can also be in the footer. The Hello Theme’s customizer and the Menu widget are great ways to build your menu. \n\nA website’s menu is used to navigate the site and is usually located in the header section.\nNext steps\n\nYou’re now ready to start building your WordPress website! You have a few options as to where to go from here. If you’re looking to get started right away with a hosting and website building package, check out the Elementor hosted website. If you’re looking to separately purchase site and page building software, check out the Elementor and Elementor Pro plugins, which will work on any WordPress site. \nTo get the most out of Elementor, head over to the Elementor Academy for more helpful learning resources.

We recommend you to contact your hosting provider to upgrade to the latest version of PHP.\n\nElementor may also work with PHP 7.0+, but these older versions have reached official End Of Life and as such may expose your site to security vulnerabilities and bugs, and may not always work as expected.\n\nMySQL 5.6 or Greater\n\nMySQL version 5.6 or greater OR MariaDB version 10.0 or greater.\n\nWP Memory Limit\n\nWP Memory limit of 256 MB (Elementor and Elementor Pro only), 512 MB recommended, 768 MB for best performance.\n\nNote: These requirements are for Elementor. If you are using additional plugins on your site that also have minimum requirements such as WooCommerce, you may need to increase your memory to 512 MB to help avoid loading issues. See also, the following documentation Elementor Widget Panel Not Loading.\n\nBrowsers\n\nAs web technology develops, it’s important for users to keep their websites up-to-date. Older browsers may not support the full set of features provided by Elementor. Following is a chart of the systems that are supported by Elementor:\n\nBrowser\tElementor Editor – Desktop Only\tFrontend – Desktop\tFrontend – Tablet/Mobile\nGoogle Chrome\t100.x and above\t100.x and above\t100.x and above\nMicrosoft Edge\t100.x and above\t100.x and above\t100.x and above\nBrave \t100.x and above\t100.x and above\t100.x and above\nFirefox\t100.x and above\t100.x and above\t100.x and above\nSafari\tMacOS Safari 14 and above\tMacOS Safari 14 and above\tiOS Safari 14 and above\nOthers\tLatest versions preferred\tLatest versions preferred\tLatest versions preferred\nNote\nNote: No versions of Internet Explorer are supported. If IE support is critical for you, you may need to hire a developer to add custom code.\n\nNote for Elementor hosted websites: To help secure your website, Elementor requires browsers have a minimum TLS version 1.2 in order to visit Elementor hosted websites. This means that some old browsers may have trouble accessing these sites. If this is an issue for you, contact support to adjust the TLS settings.  Elementor Cloud websites with custom domain names are unaffected by this change.\n\nDevice\n\nYou cannot edit with Elementor on mobile phones and tablets at this time. You can only edit pages with Elementor on desktop computers.\n\nServers\n\nIf your website is hosted by WP Engine, you might need to add SSL to your website to avoid saving issues.\n\nIf you use SiteGround or GoDaddy, make sure that they modify the SubstituteMaxLineLength of your server for you\n\nX-Frame options\n\nIt has to be set to “same origin” to avoid editing issues. Please ask your host to do this for you.\n\nCSP: frame-ancestors\n\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors none setting breaks Elementor Editor because it blocks the <iframe id=”elementor-preview-iframe”> that is needed for the Editor preview. This should be set to Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' to avoid editing issues. Please ask your host to do this for you.\n\nPHP Z-Lib Extension\n\nIt is preferable to have PHP Zlib extension enabled on your server.

(Intro)\nShare Usage Data\nInstalling Elementor Core\nInstalling Elementor Pro\nFAQs\nGet Started with Elementor Hosting\nGet Started with Static Hosting\nAccounts\nBilling\nWordPress\nElementor Editor\nCustomize your website\nElementor Hosting\nPlugins\nKnown Issues\nGlossary\nNew Features\nKnown Issues\nWhat is Elementor for WordPress?\nLast Update: November 2, 2023\n\nCreating a website by writing HTML code, integrating CSS styles, and debugging a website’s backend are daunting tasks even for experienced professionals. WordPress and Elementor work together to make coding a thing of the past, enabling anyone to quickly create a professional website. \n\nIn this guide, we’ll take a look at what WordPress and Elementor are and how they work together to save you time developing sleek professional websites.\n\nLet’s first take a look at WordPress.\n\nWhat is WordPress?\nWP Admin with the Elementor plugin installed.\n\nWordPress is a content management system (CMS) that simplifies the process of creating blogging websites. \n\nAt it’s core, it’s a user-friendly way to create the database underpinning your website without any need to know SQL, the standard database language.  In addition to being designed for non-programmers, WordPress is an open-source platform; meaning it’s free to use. This open source approach led to the growth of a large and thriving global WordPress community in which members create themes and plugins to help others build their websites, and extend WordPress’s capabilites. \n\nElementor is one such plugin that has found popularity within the community thanks to its powerful editing and site building tools – tools which make building professional WordPress sites even more efficient and intuitive.  \n\nDid you know? WordPress powers ~43% of all websites on the internet!\n\nWordPress.org\n\nWordPress.org provides you with the software to create your own website. It can be referred to as self-hosted WordPress because you are responsible for hosting or, in most cases, finding a third-party, to host your site. So while the software is free, you will most likely have to pay for someone to host your site. There are a few other limitations:\n\nNo drag and drop editing capabilities\nYou are responsible for backing up and maintaining your site\nYou are responsible for the security of your site\nWhere does Elementor fit in?\n\nElementor is a popular WordPress website and webpage builder plugin that brings its own tools to the WordPress world. Perhaps the easiest way to look at it is that WordPress provides a building’s framework, while it’s Elementor that lets you build the beautiful mansion resting on this infrastructure. \n\nOne of the key tools allowing you to build your “mansion” is the Elementor Editor. This visual drag and drop editor allows web creators to seamlessly build webpages capable of sophisticated, dynamic functionality. \n\nBy using the editor to drag and drop widgets onto your page, you can save time creating your masterpiece. It means working more intuitively, with no need to code in order to create a professional website.\n\nWith the Elementor Editor, users drag and drop widgets onto the canvas to create a page.\n\nWhile the Elementor Editor allows you to build beautiful web pages, the Theme Builder allows you to put these pages together to create an entire website. Using the Theme Builder you create headers and footers for your pages, templates allowing you to create uniform pages and posts and even a creative, fun 404 page designed just for your site.\n\nThe Theme Builder transformed Elementor from a webpage editor to a site builder.\n\nNot only that, if you don’t have the time, or inclination to design your own site, Elementor comes with a kit library filled with ready-to-use sites that you just need to add your own content to.   \n\nAlong with the free version of Elementor, there’s Elementor Pro, which is designed to give you more advanced professional features. These powerful tools include drag and drop ecommerce tools, embedded forms, and customizable features. \n\nIf you’ve had to code your own websites you know these features can take days to implement and test successfully. With Elementor and Elementor Pro, drag and drop means hours not days to complete a project. It also means you’re not worrying about how your code is working or how it might break.   \n\nThe bottom line\n\nWordPress was built, and does a great job of, holding the content of a website. Elementor was created with design in mind, making the process of building attractive, sophisticated, professional websites faster and more efficient. Drag and drop editing, the Theme Builder, the Kit Library, all combine to make Elementor a popular plugin to use on any WordPress website project. Elementor is a visual editor that keeps your workflow lean while providing you with a professional website when you’re done! \n\nHave more questions?

When you set out to create a website with no experience, figuring out how to start can be daunting. In this article, we break everything down to give you a solid foundation to start on.\n\nIf you’re already familiar with Elementor, WordPress, and websites, check out Getting Started With Elementor and Designing With the Elementor Editor. \n\nAssuming you’re still reading and looking for more information, let’s start from the beginning and work our way up to ensure you’ve got all the information you need to get started!  \n\nWhat is a website?\n\nWhen you visit any website, whether it’s an online store, a news outlet, or a vacation resort, you’re actually looking at a collection of pages–web pages. These are just like the documents on your computer; they’re organized into collections of files and folders. \n\nOf course, unlike the documents on your computer, these documents sit on a centralized computer known as a server. This server is connected to a network, which we all know as the internet and serves these documents to local computers like your own. \n\nWhen you’re looking at the website of the ‘Acme Seaside Resort’ in Kauai, for example, what you’re actually doing is sending a request via your computer to a server asking it to ‘serve up’ the data that makes the page. The server takes the query, and looks at its database to compile, or build, a page for you. (There are systems which use files instead of databases but we’ll skip that for now).  \n\nThe information in the database contains everything needed for the web page layout, including the text, images, videos, downloadable documents, and so on. In our example, the data may contain information about the resort’s location, pricing, and photos of the surrounding area. \n\nThis system seems easy, but there’s two big challenges to making these sites available to everyone everywhere. One of the main issues is the need for a unified way to access websites and how to create a system to organize and publish them successfully. \n\nIn the next sections, we’ll take a look at the code working behind the scenes of a website and how a browser uses this code to create web pages after the server has gathered the data.\n\nWhat is a web browser?\n\nWe’ve already discussed that a server is just a computer on a network (like the internet) that serves up files when queried. The question is what does your computer do with that data to create a website? This is where a browser comes in. \n\nA browser allows you to send and receive internet queries and data through your PC or mobile device in a standardized way. This is called a protocol. In essence, a protocol is just a format in which you send your queries or data. \n\nAs mentioned before, when you request a webpage from the server you get data packets back. This includes the page’s basic layout from the HTML along with other artifacts. The browser then takes that data and ‘parses’ or interprets this data and displays it on your screen. The browser can do this because the data is standardized. \n\nBy now we’ve gone over how requests are made, how the data is formatted, and how it is sent to your device. Now take a look at what codes are used to run the whole process. \n\nFundamentally, code is a set of instructions that we use to tell a computer what to do. Websites use a few different languages to create a web page, make it attractive and turn a static webpage into something users can interact with.\n\nAlphabet soup: HTML, CSS, JS\n\nWay back in the early days of computing, most content was created, and viewed, using proprietary software. This meant that you would create a document in a specific program, and the document could only be read by that specific program. \n\nThere was some movement toward making documents more shareable, but it was the internet that made this standardization essential. If everyone across the planet was going to begin sharing information, there would have to be a standard way of presenting this information. Thus was born the HyperText Markup Language or HTML – a new standard in structuring documents,\n\nHTML was created to arrange data into documents or webpages, and while it was great to create fairly simple straightforward formatting, something else was needed to style these pages. The answer was cascading style sheets (CSS), a language standard that took ugly HTML plain text websites and made them visually appealing. Attention then turned to adding functionality.\n\nAdding functionality\n\nJavaScript (JS) soon followed CSS, which allowed you to animate menu systems like dropdowns and work as functioning code. These days JS is also used with database querying languages like sequential querying language (SQL) to enable data entry into a database. This allows for added functionality such as saving a user’s details.\n\nNext: easier website building\n\nAt this point you may be thinking that you now need to learn several different programming languages to create a modern website. Thankfully, you don’t. To make website creation accessible, some very smart people came up with modern website building solutions. \n\nThese solutions create an interface between a website developer and the underlying code that allows you to add features with no need to code – similar to the way you can create a document on your device with an email program or word processor.  Now, instead of spending weeks creating a website, you can be finished in a few hours.\n\nIn the next section we’ll look at Elementor, one of the most powerful and popular tools among web creators and used to construct over 11 million websites.\n\nElementor: no coding, no problem.\n\nThe idea of creating websites without coding can trace its roots back to 2003 with the creation of WordPress, a content management system (CMS) –  for more on how Elementor works in conjunction with WordPress, check out the article – WordPress and Elementor – Same? Different? What’s What?\n\nA typical WordPress dashboard with the Elementor plugin installed.\n\nWhile this was a great first step, there was still a need to make working with WordPress more user friendly and accessible. \n\nEnter Yoni Luksenberg and Ariel Klikstein in 2016, two web creators who came up with the idea of building a visual editor for web pages. Instead of coding the different elements of a web page, creators can simply drag and drop elements onto a canvas. Thus, the Elementor Editor was born. \n\nA short time later, a new feature called Theme Builder was added to the Editor. With this feature, the Editor went from being the best WordPress page builder to being the best WordPress site builder.  \n\nThe Elementor editor has a panel, on the left side, which displays widgets and controls, and the canvas where you build your page.\n\nSince its inception, Elementor has become a widely popular tool used by many web creators around the globe. \n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe internet and websites have come a long way from their humble beginnings. Interactive functionality and professional aesthetics originally meant you needed to be fluent in many diverse programming languages just to build a simple website. Now, all you need to create a sleek, interactive, dynamic website is the proper tools. \n\nWordPress enables you to create websites efficiently and takes you away from all the tedious backend work. That said, you still need some technical skills to create and publish your website using WordPress alone. To solve this, Elementor works with WordPress to give you powerful drag and drop visual editing and web-building capabilities. It also streamlines the publishing workflow. \n\nThis makes Elementor a great choice to start your journey to becoming a top-notch web creator. \n\nHave more questions?
